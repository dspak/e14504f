It is likely that there are undiscovered Th2 signaling molecules. Although steroids are known to be immunoregulators, de novo steroid production from immune cells has not been previously characterized. Here, we demonstrate production of the steroid pregnenolone by Th2 cells in vitro and in vivo in a helminth infection model. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing and quantitative {PCR} analysis suggest that pregnenolone synthesis in Th2 cells is related to immunosuppression. In support of this, we show that pregnenolone inhibits Th cell proliferation and B cell immunoglobulin class switching. We also show that steroidogenic Th2 cells inhibit Th cell proliferation in a Cyp11a1 enzyme-dependent manner. We propose pregnenolone as a “lymphosteroid,” a steroid produced by lymphocytes. We speculate that this de novo steroid production may be an intrinsic phenomenon of Th2-mediated immune responses to actively restore immune homeostasis.,

	abstract = {Allergic asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity and is thought to be mediated by an adaptive T helper-2 (Th2) cell-type immune resp-onse. Here, we demonstrate that type 2 pulmonary innate lymphoid cells ({ILC}2s) significantly contribute to production of the key cytokines {IL}-5 and {IL}-13 in experimental asthma. In naive mice, lineage-marker negative {ILC}2s expressing {IL}-7Rα, {CD}25, Sca-1, and T1/{ST}2({IL}-33R) were present in lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes ({MedLNs}), but not in broncho-alveolar lavage ({BAL}) fluid. Upon intranasal administration of {IL}-25 or {IL}-33, an asthma phenotype was induced, whereby {ILC}2s accumulated in lungs, {MedLNs}, and {BAL} fluid. After {IL}-25 and {IL}-33 administration, {ILC}2s constituted ∼50 and ∼80\% of {IL}-5+/{IL}-13+ cells in lung and {BAL}, respectively. Also in house dust mite-induced or ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma, the {ILC}2 population in lung and {BAL} fluid increased significantly in size and {ILC}2s were a major source of {IL}-5 or {IL}-13. Particularly in {OVA}-induced asthma, the contribution of {ILC}2s to the total population of intracellular {IL}-5+ and {IL}-13+ cells in the lung was in the same range as found for Th2 cells. We conclude that both {ILC}2s and Th2 cells produce large amounts of {IL}-5 and {IL}-13 that contribute to allergic airway inflammation.},

	abstract = {The 2013 Boston marathon was disrupted by two bombs placed near the finish line. The bombs resulted in three deaths and several hundred injuries. Of lesser concern, in the immediate aftermath, was the fact that nearly 6,000 runners failed to finish the race. We were approached by the marathon's organizers, the Boston Athletic Association ({BAA}), and asked to recommend a procedure for projecting finish times for the runners who could not complete the race. With assistance from the {BAA}, we created a dataset consisting of all the runners in the 2013 race who reached the halfway point but failed to finish, as well as all runners from the 2010 and 2011 Boston marathons. The data consist of split times from each of the 5 km sections of the course, as well as the final 2.2 km (from 40 km to the finish). The statistical objective is to predict the missing split times for the runners who failed to finish in 2013. We set this problem in the context of the matrix completion problem, examples of which include imputing missing data in {DNA} microarray experiments, and the Netflix prize problem. We propose five prediction methods and create a validation dataset to measure their performance by mean squared error and other measures. The best method used local regression based on a K-nearest-neighbors algorithm ({KNN} method), though several other methods produced results of similar quality. We show how the results were used to create projected times for the 2013 runners and discuss potential for future application of the same methodology. We present the whole project as an example of reproducible research, in that we are able to make the full data and all the algorithms we have used publicly available, which may facilitate future research extending the methods or proposing completely different approaches.},

Recent literature has begun to describe and identify predictors of hitting the wall among recreational marathon runners. Our purpose was to extend previous findings by exploring the relative probability of when runners of various risk profiles hit the wall and to describe the overall functional form of risk over the course of a marathon.
Method
Survival methods and discrete-time hazard modeling were used to model self-reported hitting the wall occurrence data among 324 recreational marathon runners from four Eastern Seaboard marathons.
Results
The combinative effects of male gender, running 20 miles or less in training, and expectancy, showed the greatest probability of hitting the wall at any timepoint of the marathon. The shape of hitting the wall risk appeared to most closely fit a cubic form with a dramatic incline of risk peaking at mile 21 followed by a precipitous decline.
Conclusion
These findings further clarify under what circumstances recreational marathon runners are most and least likely to hit the wall and contributes to the formation of a conceptual definition of the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Author Summary
Marathon running, historically perceived as testing the physiologic limits of human endurance, has become increasingly popular even among recreational runners. Of those runners who test their endurance by racing the marathon distance, however, more than two in five report ‘hitting the wall,’ the rapid onset of severe fatigue and inability to maintain a high-intensity pace, resulting from the near-complete depletion of carbohydrate stores in the leg muscles and liver. An apparent paradox of long-distance running is that even the leanest athletes store enough fat to power back-to-back marathons, yet small carbohydrate reservoirs can nevertheless catastrophically limit performance in endurance exercise. In this study I develop and validate a mathematical model that facilitates computation of personalized estimates of the distances at which runners will exhaust their carbohydrate stores while running at selected paces. In addition, I provide a systematic approach to estimating personalized maximum speeds at which runners can safely complete a marathon, based on accessible physiologic parameters such as heart rate and running speed. This analysis provides a quantitative basis for improving the safety and optimizing the performance of endurance runners, evaluating midrace fueling requirements, and estimating limits of performance in human endurance running, for elite and recreational runners alike.},

	abstract = {Classification of suspect powders, by using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) spectra, to determine if they could contain Bacillus anthracis spores is difficult because of the variability in their composition and the variability typically associated with {LIBS} analysis. A method that builds a support vector machine classification model for such spectra relying on the known elemental composition of the Bacillus spores was developed. A wavelet transformation was incorporated in this method to allow for possible thresholding or standardization, then a linear model technique using the known elemental structure of the spores was incorporated for dimension reduction, and a support vector machine approach was employed for the final classification of the substance. The method was applied to real data produced from an {LIBS} device. Several methods used to test the predictive performance of the classification model revealed promising results. Published 2012.

	abstract = {Anthrax toxin consists of three nontoxic proteins that associate in binary or ternary combinations to form toxic complexes at the surface of mammalian cells. One of these proteins, protective antigen ({PA}), transports the other two, edema factor ({EF}) and lethal factor ({LF}), to the cytosol. {LF} is a Zn2+-protease that cleaves certain {MAP} kinase kinases, leading to death of the host via a poorly defined sequence of events. {EF}, a calmodulin- and Ca2+-dependent adenylate cyclase, is responsible for the edema seen in the disease. Both enzymes are believed to benefit the bacteria by inhibiting cells of the host's innate immune system. Assembly of toxic complexes begins after {PA} binds to cellular receptors and is cleaved into two fragments by furin proteases. The smaller fragment dissociates, allowing the receptor-bound fragment, {PA}63 (63 {kDa}), to self-associate and form a ring-shaped, heptameric pore precursor (prepore). The prepore binds up to three molecules of {EF} and/or {LF}, and the resulting complexes are endocytosed and trafficked to an acidic compartment. There, the prepore converts to a transmembrane pore, mediating translocation of {EF} and {LF} to the cytosol. Recent studies have revealed (a) the identity of receptors; (b) crystallographic structures of the three toxin proteins and the heptameric {PA}63 prepore; and (c) information about toxin assembly, entry, and action within the cytosol. Knowledge of the structure and mode of action of the toxin has unveiled potential applications in medicine, including approaches to treating anthrax infections.},

	abstract = {Background/objectives
Anthrax vaccine adsorbed ({AVA}, {BioThrax}®) is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis administration for the {US} population in response to large-scale Bacillus anthracis spore exposure. However, no information exists on {AVA} use in children and ethical barriers exist to performing pre-event pediatric {AVA} studies. A Presidential Ethics Commission proposed a potential pathway for such studies utilizing an age de-escalation process comparing safety and immunogenicity data from 18 to 20 year-olds to older adults and if acceptable proceeding to evaluations in younger adolescents. We conducted exploratory summary re-analyses of existing databases from 18 to 20 year-olds (n = 74) compared to adults aged 21 to 29 years (n = 243) who participated in four previous {US} government funded {AVA} studies.
Methods
Data extracted from studies included elicited local injection-site and systemic adverse events ({AEs}) following {AVA} doses given subcutaneously at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Additionally, proportions of subjects with ≥4-fold antibody rises from baseline to post-second and post-third {AVA} doses (seroresponse) were obtained.
Results
Rates of any elicited local {AEs} were not significantly different between younger and older age groups for local events (79.2\% vs. 83.8\%, P = 0.120) or systemic events (45.4\% vs. 50.5\%, P = 0.188). Robust and similar proportions of seroresponses to vaccination were observed in both age groups.
Conclusions
{AVA} was safe and immunogenic in 18 to 20 year-olds compared to 21 to 29 year-olds. These results provide initial information to anthrax and pediatric specialists if {AVA} studies in adolescents are required.},

Beta-lactamases (penicillin amido-beta-lactamhydrolase {EC} 3.5.2.6) offer a number of advantages which might make them useful in immunoassay systems. We linked beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus with biotin and used the biotinillated enzyme to devise immunoassay systems for the detection of a number of microbial antigens. An assay system in which antibodies to the polyribitol phosphate antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b were used was capable of detecting between 0.4 and 1.6 ng of that antigen. Similarly, an assay in which antibodies to the common antigens of adenoviruses and biotin-linked beta-lactamase were used was capable of detecting between 1 and 10 50\% tissue culture infective doses of a strain of enteric-type adenovirus. When applied to the detection of rotavirus, a similar system in which biotinillated beta-lactamase was used was capable of detecting small amounts of antigen in a standard rotavirus preparation. This assay could also detect virus in 36 of 37 stool specimens from children with rotavirus gastroenteritis. The positive specimens could easily be distinguished from negative ones by the naked eye, and a permanent record of the qualitative results could be obtained by the use of a standard office photocopying machine. Beta-lactamases have promise for use in practical enzyme immunoassay systems, especially in situations in which expensive colorimetric instrumentation is not available.},

The three main categories investigated are physical, germination, and chemical methods for liberation of dpa from B. subtilis endospores. Attention is concentrated on the speed, efficiency, and simplicity of the extraction techniques for optimization of endospore detection using terbium–dipicolinate photoluminescence. Although methods from all categories succeeded in extracting dpa, the technique utilizing heated dodecylamine (dda) extracted the majority of the available dpa in less than 3 min. Application of the dda extraction procedure to the terbium–dipicolinate photoluminescence method in conjunction with an increased detection capability resulted in a two-order of magnitude improvement in endospore detection. This combination of methods resulted the lowest reported limit of detection ({LOD}) (1000 {CFU}/ml) for a terbium–dipicolinate photoluminescence method in the shortest reported time (5–7 min) for the total procedure.},

A few of the samples tested such as the soot (not included in the model) and the 25\% {BG}:75\% dust mixture resulted in a significant number of false positives or false negatives, respectively. Our preliminary results indicate that while {LIBS} is able to discriminate biomaterials with similar elemental compositions at standoff distances based on differences in key intensity ratios, further work is needed to reduce the number of false positives/negatives by refining the {PLS}-{DA} model to include a sufficient range of material classes and carefully selecting a detection threshold. In addition, we have demonstrated that {LIBS} can distinguish five different organophosphate nerve agent simulants at 20 meters, despite their similar stoichiometric formulas.

Three common spore/aerosol scenarios were evaluated, diesel truck exhaust (to simulate a truck running outside of a building air intake), urban outdoor aerosol (to simulate common building air), and finally a protein aerosol (to simulate either an agent mixture (ricin/anthrax) or a contaminated anthrax sample). Two statistical methods, linear correlation and principal component analysis, were assessed for differentiation of surrogate spore spectra from other common aerosols. Criteria for determining percentages of false positives and false negatives via correlation analysis were evaluated. A single laser shot analysis of approximately 4 percent of the spores in a mixture of 0.75 m(3) urban outdoor air doped with approximately 1.1 x 10(5) spores resulted in a 0.04 proportion of false negatives. For that same sample volume of urban air without spores, the proportion of false positives was 0.08.},

	abstract = {Nanosecond single-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy({LIBS}) has been used to discriminate between two different genera of Gram-negative bacteria and between several strains of the Escherichia coli bacterium based on the relative concentration of trace inorganic elements in the bacteria. Of particular importance in all such studies to date has been the role of divalent cations, specifically Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + , which are present in the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and act to aggregate the highly polar lipopolysaccharide molecules. We have demonstrated that the source of emission from Ca and Mg atoms observed in {LIBS} plasmas from bacteria is at least partially located at the outer membrane by intentionally altering membrane biochemistry and correlating these changes with the observed changes in the {LIBSspectra}. The definitive assignment of some fraction of the {LIBS} emission to the outer membrane composition establishes a potential serological, or surface-antigen, basis for the laser-based identification. E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured in three nutrient media: trypticase soy agar as a control, a {MacConkey} agar with a 0.01\% concentration of bile salts including sodium deoxycholate, and a trypticase soy agar with a 0.4\% deoxycholate concentration. The higher concentration of deoxycholate is known to disrupt bacterial outer membrane integrity and was expected to induce changes in the observed {LIBSspectra}. Altered {LIBS} emission was observed for bacteria cultured in this 0.4\% medium and laser ablated in an all-argon environment. These spectra evidenced a reduced calcium emission and in the case of one species, a reduced magnesium emission. Culturing on the lower (0.01\%) concentration of bile salts altered the {LIBSspectra} for both the P. aeruginosa and two strains of E. coli in a highly reproducible way, although not nearly as significantly as culturing in the higher concentration of deoxycholate did. This was possibly due to the accumulation of divalent cations around the bacteria by the formation of an extracellular polysaccharide capsule. Lastly, a discriminant function analysis demonstrated that in spite of alterations in the {LIBSspectrum} induced by growth in the three different media, the analysis could correctly identify all samples better than 90\% of the time. This encouraging result illustrates the potential utility of {LIBS} as a rapid bacteriological identification technology.},

Specific features of {femtosecondLIBS} have been demonstrated, very attractive for analyzing biological sample: (i) a lower plasma temperature leading to negligible nitrogen and oxygen emissions from excited ambient air and a better contrast in detection of trace mineral species; and (ii) a specific ablation regime that favors intramolecular bonds emission with respect to atomic emission. A precise kinetic study of molecular band head intensities allows distinguishing the contribution of native {CN} bonds released by the sample from that due to carbon recombination with atmospheric nitrogen. Furthermore a sensitive detection of trace mineral elements provide specific spectral signature of different bacteria. An example is given for the Gram test provided by different magnesium emissions from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. An entire spectrum consists of hundred resolved lines belonging to 13 atomic or molecular species, which provides an ensemble of valuable data to identify different bacteria.},

	abstract = {The association of genetic variation with disease and drug response, and improvements in nucleic acid technologies, have given great optimism for the impact of ‘genomic medicine’. However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the {DNA} sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2–40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies {DNA} in a cell-free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next-generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of ‘personalized genome sequencing’.},

	abstract = {The human gut harbors thousands of bacterial taxa. A profusion of metagenomic sequence data has been generated from human stool samples in the last few years, raising the question of whether more taxa remain to be identified. We assessed metagenomic data generated by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium to determine if novel taxa remain to be discovered in stool samples from healthy individuals. To do this, we established a rigorous bioinformatics pipeline that uses sequence data from multiple platforms (Illumina {GAIIX} and Roche 454 {FLX} Titanium) and approaches (whole-genome shotgun and 16S {rDNA} amplicons) to validate novel taxa. We applied this approach to stool samples from 11 healthy subjects collected as part of the Human Microbiome Project. We discovered several low-abundance, novel bacterial taxa, which span three major phyla in the bacterial tree of life. We determined that these taxa are present in a larger set of Human Microbiome Project subjects and are found in two sampling sites (Houston and St. Louis). We show that the number of false-positive novel sequences (primarily chimeric sequences) would have been two orders of magnitude higher than the true number of novel taxa without validation using multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of establishing rigorous standards for the identification of novel taxa in metagenomic data. The majority of novel sequences are related to the recently discovered genus Barnesiella, further encouraging efforts to characterize the members of this genus and to study their roles in the microbial communities of the gut. A better understanding of the effects of less-abundant bacteria is important as we seek to understand the complex gut microbiome in healthy individuals and link changes in the microbiome to disease.},

Asthma phenotypes were initially focused on combinations of clinical characteristics, but they are now evolving to link biology to phenotype, often through a statistically based process. Ongoing studies of large-scale, molecularly and genetically focused and extensively clinically characterized cohorts of asthma should enhance our ability to molecularly understand these phenotypes and lead to more targeted and personalized approaches to asthma therapy.},

	abstract = {There is current evidence to demonstrate a close association between fungal sensitisation and asthma severity. Whether such an association is causal remains to be confirmed, but this is explored by means of a detailed literature review. There is evidence from two randomised controlled trials that, in the example of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ({ABPA}), treatment with systemic antifungal therapy can offer a therapeutic benefit to ∼60\% of patients. {ABPA} is only diagnosed if a combination of clinical and immunological criteria is achieved. It is not known whether such cases are a discrete clinical entity or part of a spectrum of the pulmonary allergic response to fungi or fungal products.
This paper describes the epidemiological evidence that associates severity of asthma with fungi and discusses possible pathogenetic mechanisms. Many airborne fungi are involved, including species of Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium, and exposure may be indoors, outdoors or both. The potential for a therapeutic role of antifungal agents for patients with severe asthma and fungal sensitisation is also explored.
Not only are many patients with severe asthma desperately disabled by their disease, but, in the {UK} alone, asthma accounts for 1,500 deaths per yr. The healthcare costs of these patients are enormous and any treatment option merits close scrutiny. Within this report, the case for the consideration of a new term related to this association is put forward. The current authors propose the term “severe asthma with fungal sensitisation”. However, it is recognised that enhanced and precise definition of fungal sensitisation will require improvements in diagnostic testing.},

	abstract = {The function of many intrinsic membrane proteins requires a conformational transition that is often strongly influenced by the molecular composition of the bilayer in which the protein is embedded. Recently, a mechanism for this shift in conformational equilibrium was suggested, in which it is argued that a shift in distribution of lateral pressures of the bilayer resulting from a change in lipid composition alters the amount of mechanical work of the protein conformational transition, if the change in the cross-sectional area profile of the protein varies with depth within the bilayer. As there is little information on the change in shape of the transmembrane region of any protein, various simple geometric models are considered. For both a generic model, and more specific models that approximate likely cooperative rearrangements of alpha-helices in bundles, it is found that the conformational equilibrium depends on the first and second integral moments of the lateral pressure distribution. In addition to revealing the possible physical underpinnings of the well-known correlation between protein activity and the 'nonlamellar' tendency of bilayer lipids, this dependence on moments of the pressure profile allows for prediction of the relative effects of different lipid compositional changes even in the absence of information on specific protein shape changes. Effects of variation in acyl chain length, degree and position of cis-unsaturation, and addition of cholesterol and small interfacially-active solutes (n-alkanols) are compared.},

	abstract = {Advanced (long-chain) fuels and chemicals are generated from short-chain metabolic intermediates through pathways that require carbon-chain elongation. The condensation reactions mediating this carbon-carbon bond formation can be catalysed by enzymes from the thiolase superfamily, including β-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier protein ({ACP}) synthases, polyketide synthases, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-{CoA} synthases, and biosynthetic thiolases. Pathways involving these enzymes have been exploited for fuel and chemical production, with fatty-acid biosynthesis (β-ketoacyl-{ACP} synthases) attracting the most attention in recent years. Degradative thiolases, which are part of the thiolase superfamily and naturally function in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, can also operate in the synthetic direction and thus enable carbon-chain elongation. Here we demonstrate that a functional reversal of the β-oxidation cycle can be used as a metabolic platform for the synthesis of alcohols and carboxylic acids with various chain lengths and functionalities. This pathway operates with coenzyme A ({CoA}) thioester intermediates and directly uses acetyl-{CoA} for acyl-chain elongation (rather than first requiring {ATP}-dependent activation to malonyl-{CoA}), characteristics that enable product synthesis at maximum carbon and energy efficiency. The reversal of the β-oxidation cycle was engineered in Escherichia coli and used in combination with endogenous dehydrogenases and thioesterases to synthesize n-alcohols, fatty acids and 3-hydroxy-, 3-keto- and trans-Δ(2)-carboxylic acids. The superior nature of the engineered pathway was demonstrated by producing higher-chain linear n-alcohols (C ≥ 4) and extracellular long-chain fatty acids (C {\textgreater} 10) at higher efficiency than previously reported. The ubiquitous nature of β-oxidation, aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase and thioesterase enzymes has the potential to enable the efficient synthesis of these products in other industrial organisms.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Abdominal wall and inguinal hernia repair are the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States and Europe. However, traditional methods of mesh fixation are associated with a number of problems including substantial risks of recurrence and of postoperative and chronic pain. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the clinical safety and efficacy of Tisseel/Tissucol fibrin sealant for hernia mesh fixation.


{METHODS}

A {PubMed} title/abstract search was conducted using the following terms: (fibrin glue {OR} fibrin sealant {OR} Tisseel {OR} Tissucol) {AND} hernia repair. The bibliographies of the publications identified in the search were reviewed for additional references.


{RESULTS}

There were 36 Tisseel/Tissucol studies included in this review involving 5,993 patients undergoing surgery for hernia. In open repair of inguinal hernias, Tisseel compared favorably with traditional methods of mesh fixation, being associated with shorter operative times and hospital stays and a lower incidence of chronic pain. Similarly, after laparoscopic/endoscopic inguinal hernia repair, Tisseel/Tissucol was associated with less use of postoperative analgesics and less acute and chronic postoperative pain than tissue-penetrating mesh-fixation methods. Other end points of concern to surgeons and patients are the risks of inguinal hernia recurrence and of complications such as hematoma formation and intraoperative bleeding. Comparative studies show that Tisseel/Tissucol does not increase the risk of these outcomes and may, in fact, decrease the risk compared with tissue-penetrating fixation methods. When used in the repair of incisional hernias, Tisseel/Tissucol significantly decreased both postoperative morbidity and duration of hospital stay.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Clinical evidence published to date supports the use of Tisseel/Tissucol as an option for mesh fixation in open and laparoscopic/endoscopic repair of inguinal and incisional hernias. Guidelines of the International Endohernia Society recommend fibrin sealant mesh fixation, especially in inguinal hernia repair. Nonfixation is reserved for selected cases.},

The protein consists of an N- and a C-terminal domain, each formed by a compact bundle of six transmembrane alpha-helices. The substrate-translocation pore is found at the domain interface and faces the cytoplasm. At the closed end of the pore is the substrate binding site, which is formed by two arginine residues. In combination with biochemical data, the crystal structure suggests a single binding site, alternating access mechanism for substrate translocation, namely, the substrate bound at the N- and C-terminal domain interface is transported across the membrane via a rocker-switch type of movement of the domains. Furthermore, {GlpT} may serve as a structural and mechanistic paradigm for other secondary active membrane transporters.},

Gibberella zeae (anamorph Fusarium graminearum) is the causal agent of Fusarium head blight ({FHB}) of wheat and barley in the United States. Ascospores forcibly discharged from mature fruiting bodies, the perithecia, serve as the primary inoculum for {FHB} epidemics. To identify genes important for perithecium development and function, a {cDNA} microarray that covered 11\% of the G. zeae genome was constructed. The microarray was used to measure changes in transcription levels of genes expressed during three successive stages of perithecium development. When compared with vegetative mycelia, 651 (31\%) {cDNA} clones showed changes in transcript levels in at least one of the three developmental stages. During perithecium development, 263 (13\%) {cDNA} clones showed temporal changes in transcript profiles. Transcripts that showed the greatest changes in levels in maturing perithecia belonged to genes in the {FunCat} main functional categories of cell rescue, metabolism, cell type differentiation, energy, and cellular transport. For genes related to metabolism and cell type differentiation, transcripts showed the highest levels in immature perithecia, whereas for cellular transport-related genes, transcripts showed the highest levels in mature perithecia. This study represents the first large-scale investigation of both spatial and temporal changes in transcript levels during perithecium development. It provides clear evidence that the sexual development in fungi is a complex, multigenic process and identifies genes involved in sexual development of this agriculturally important fungus.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Studying the interplay between gene expression and metabolite levels can yield important information on the physiology of stress responses and adaptation strategies. Performing transcriptomics and metabolomics in parallel during time-series experiments represents a systematic way to gain such information. Several combined profiling datasets have been added to the public domain and they form a valuable resource for hypothesis generating studies. Unfortunately, detecting coresponses between transcript levels and metabolite abundances is non-trivial: they cannot be assumed to overlap directly with underlying biochemical pathways and they may be subject to time delays and obscured by considerable noise.Results: Our aim was to predict pathway comemberships between metabolites and genes based on their coresponses to applied stress. We found that in the presence of strong noise and time-shifted responses, a hidden Markov model-based similarity outperforms the simpler Pearson correlation but performs comparably or worse in their absence. Therefore, we propose a supervised method that applies pathway information to summarize similarity statistics to a consensus statistic that is more informative than any of the single measures. Using four combined profiling datasets, we show that comembership between metabolites and genes can be predicted for numerous {KEGG} pathways; this opens opportunities for the detection of transcriptionally regulated pathways and novel metabolically related genes.Availability: A command-line software tool is available at http://www.cin.ufpe.br/{\textasciitilde}igcf/Metabolites.Contact: henning@psc.riken.jp; igcf@cin.ufpe.{brSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

To increase both resolution and support on a large-scale phylogeny of lichenized and non-lichenized ascomycetes, we combined the protein coding-gene {RPB}2 with the traditionally used nuclear ribosomal genes {SSU} and {LSU}. Our analyses resulted in the naming of the new subclasses Acarosporomycetidae and Ostropomycetidae, and the new class Lichinomycetes, as well as the establishment of the phylogenetic placement and novel circumscription of the lichen-forming fungi family Acarosporaceae. The delimitation of this family has been problematic over the past century, because its main diagnostic feature, true polyspory (numerous spores issued from multiple post-meiosis mitoses) with over 100 spores per ascus, is probably not restricted to the Acarosporaceae. This observation was confirmed by our reconstruction of the origin and evolution of this form of true polyspory using maximum likelihood as the optimality criterion. The various phylogenetic analyses carried out on our data sets allowed us to conclude that: (1) the inclusion of phylogenetic signal from ambiguously aligned regions into the maximum parsimony analyses proved advantageous in reconstructing phylogeny; however, when more data become available, Bayesian analysis using different models of evolution is likely to be more efficient; (2) neighbor-joining bootstrap proportions seem to be more appropriate in detecting topological conflict between data partitions of large-scale phylogenies than posterior probabilities; and (3) Bayesian bootstrap proportion provides a compromise between posterior probability outcomes (i.e., higher accuracy, but with a higher number of significantly supported wrong internodes) vs. maximum likelihood bootstrap proportion outcomes (i.e., lower accuracy, with a lower number of significantly supported wrong internodes).},

Montmorillonite-K10 was shown to be a highly active catalyst for dimerization but was also active in the ring opening of ?-pinene followed by dehydrogenation to produce p-cymene, which limited the yield of the dimer to ca. 75\%. Nafion was capable of producing dimers in up to 90\% yield primarily through isomerization followed by dimerization. Amberlyst-15, a common industrial catalyst had very poor activity and conversion even at 150 °C. The dimer mixtures were upgraded through hydrogenation over {PtO}2 and fractional distillation.

The main components of the volatile fraction were identified using {SPME}-{GC}/{MS}. Significant differences in the proportion of volatile constituents from truffles of different geographical areas were detected. The results suggest that, besides genetic factors, environmental conditions influence the formation of volatile organic compounds. The mass spectra of the volatile fraction of the samples were used as fingerprints to characterize the geographical origin. Next, stepwise factorial discriminant analysis afforded a limited number of characteristic fragment ions that allowed a geographical classification of the truffles studied.},

The body sites with the greatest number of core {OTUs}, defined as {OTUs} shared amongst 95\% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of {OTUs} shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus {OTU} level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus {OTUs} show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1–V3 {OTU} populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1–V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3–V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool “enterotype” profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, {OTU} level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even {OTUs} present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals.},

The genome describes a motile, photo-heterotrophic cell focused on degradation of protein and lipids and clarifies the origin of proteorhodopsin.

We verified the framework by implementing a pathway with two novel enzymatic reactions to convert isopentenyl diphosphate into 3-methyl-3-butenol, 3-methyl-2-butenol, and 3-methylbutanol. To overcome competition with native pathways that share the same substrate, we engineered two bifunctional enzymes that redirect metabolic flux toward the synthetic pathway.

	abstract = {Long-term and persistent human disturbances have simultaneously altered the stability and diversity of ecological systems, with disturbances directly reducing functional attributes such as invasion resistance, while eliminating the buffering effects of high species diversity. Theory predicts that this combination of environmental change and diversity loss increases the risk of abrupt and potentially irreversible ecosystem collapse, but long-term empirical evidence from natural systems is lacking. Here we demonstrate this relationship in a degraded but species-rich pyrogenic grassland in which the combined effects of fire suppression, invasion and trophic collapse have created a species-poor grassland that is highly productive, resilient to yearly climatic fluctuations, and resistant to invasion, but vulnerable to rapid collapse after the re-introduction of fire. We initially show how human disturbance has created a negative relationship between diversity and function, contrary to theoretical predictions. Fire prevention since the mid-nineteenth century is associated with the loss of plant species but it has stabilized high-yield annual production and invasion resistance, comparable to a managed high-yield low-diversity agricultural system. In managing for fire suppression, however, a hidden vulnerability to sudden environmental change emerges that is explained by the elimination of the buffering effects of high species diversity. With the re-introduction of fire, grasslands only persist in areas with remnant concentrations of native species, in which a range of rare and mostly functionally redundant plants proliferate after burning and prevent extensive invasion including a rapid conversion towards woodland. This research shows how biodiversity can be crucial for ecosystem stability despite appearing functionally insignificant beforehand, a relationship probably applicable to many ecosystems given the globally prevalent combination of intensive long-term land management and species loss.},

	abstract = {Alkanes are widely distributed in nature and impaired alkane synthesis was implicated in certain neurological disorders. However, the mechanism of synthesis of alkanes in animals is unknown. Our search to find a convenient animal tissue to study alkane biosynthesis resulted in the finding that the uropygial gland (a modified sebaceous gland) of the eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) produces large amounts of alkanes. These alkanes, which constitute 35-41\% of the total lipid produced, are mainly C21, C23, C25, and C27 n-alkanes. Cell free homogenates of this tissue synthesized alkanes from both fatty acid and aldehyde in the absence of O2. Differential centrifugation of the homogenates indicated that this activity was located in the microsomal fraction. With isolated microsomes conversion of fatty acid to alkane required {CoA}, {ATP}, and {NADH} whereas conversion of an aldehyde to alkane did not require the addition of cofactors. That the final step in alkane synthesis is a decarbonylation was shown by the stoichiometric production of heptadecane and {CO} from octadecanal. {CO} was identified by adsorption to {RhCl} [(C6H6)3P]3 and oxidation of the trapped {CO} to {CO}2 by watergas shift reaction. The enzyme preparation also catalyzed incorporation of 14C from 14CO into octadecanal showing the reversible nature of the decarbonylase. This decarbonylase had a sharp {pH} optimum at 7.0, a Kapp of 180 {microM} and a V1/2 of 90 rho mol/min/mg protein for octadecanal. The enzyme was inhibited by the metal chelators {EDTA}, O-phenanthroline, and 8-hydroxyquinoline, but not by {KCN}. It was stimulated nearly 3-fold by 5 {microM} 2-mercaptoethanol and inhibited by the presence of O2. During the conversion of [1-3H]octadecanal to heptadecane, 3H was lost to water and 3H from 3H2O was incorporated into the alkane generated from unlabeled octadecanal. The mechanism of the decarbonylation and the nature of the enzyme remain to be elucidated.},

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.

Microorganisms of extremely low abundance (the 'rare biosphere') are believed to be largely inaccessible and unknown. To understand the structure of complex environmental microbial communities, including the representation of rare and prevalent community members, we coupled traditional cultivation with pyrosequencing. We compared cultured and uncultured bacterial members of the same agricultural soil, including eight locations within one apple orchard and four time points. Our analysis revealed that soil bacteria captured by culturing were in very low abundance or absent in the culture-independent community, demonstrating unexpected accessibility of the rare biosphere by culturing.},

Compound I was shown to be the product of a head-to-head fatty acid condensation biosynthetic pathway dependent on genes denoted as ole (for olefin biosynthesis). Four ole genes were present in S. oneidensis {MR}-1. Deletion of the entire {oleABCD} gene cluster led to the complete absence of nonpolar extractable products. Deletion of the {oleC} gene alone generated a strain that lacked compound I but produced a structurally analogous ketone. Complementation of the {oleC} gene eliminated formation of the ketone and restored the biosynthesis of compound I. A recombinant S. oneidensis strain containing {oleA} from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain R551-3 produced at least 17 related long-chain compounds in addition to compound I, 13 of which were identified as ketones. A potential role for {OleA} in head-to-head condensation was proposed. It was further proposed that long-chain polyunsaturated compounds aid in adapting cells to a rapid drop in temperature, based on three observations. In S. oneidensis wild-type cells, the cellular concentration of polyunsaturated compounds increased significantly with decreasing growth temperature. Second, the {oleABCD} deletion strain showed a significantly longer lag phase than the wild-type strain when shifted to a lower temperature. Lastly, compound I has been identified in a significant number of bacteria isolated from cold environments.},

	abstract = {{MAGGY} is a gypsy-like {LTR} retrotransposon isolated from the blast fungus Pyricularia grisea (teleomorph, Magnaporthe grisea). We examined transposition of {MAGGY} in three P. grisea isolates (wheat, finger millet, and crabgrass pathogen), which did not originally possess a {MAGGY} element, and in two heterologous species of filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum lagenarium and P. zingiberi. Genomic Southern analysis of {MAGGY} transformants suggested that transposition of {MAGGY} occurred in all filamentous fungi tested. In contrast, no transposition was observed in any transformants with a modified {MAGGY} containing a 513-bp deletion in the reverse transcriptase domain. When a {MAGGY} derivative carrying an artificial intron was introduced into the wheat isolate of P. grisea and C. lagenarium, loss of the intron was observed. These results showed that {MAGGY} can undergo autonomous {RNA}-mediated transposition in heterologous filamentous fungi. The frequency of transposition differed among fungal species. {MAGGY} transposed actively in the wheat isolate of P. grisea and P. zingiberi, but transposition in C. lagenarium appeared to be rare. This is the first report that demonstrates active transposition of a fungal transposable element in heterologous hosts. Possible usage of {MAGGY} as a genetic tagging tool in filamentous fungi is discussed.},

An array of alternative reactions further converting lipid hydroperoxides gives rise to a large variety of oxylipin classes, some with reported signaling functions in plants, fungi, algae or animals. The structural diversity of oxylipins is further increased by their occurrence either as esters in complex lipids or as free (non-esterified) fatty acid derivatives. The enzymes involved in oxylipin metabolism are diverse and comprise a multitude of examples with interesting and unusual catalytic properties.

	doi = {10.1086/342161},
	abstract = {Over the past 20 yr much has been learned about a unique symbiotic interaction between fungal endophytes and grasses. The fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) grow intercellularly and systemically in aboveground plant parts. Vertically transmitted asexual endophytes forming asymptomatic infections of cool-season grasses have been repeatedly derived from sexual species that abort host inflorescences. The phylogenetic distribution of seed-transmitted endophytes is strongly suggestive of cocladogenesis with their hosts. Molecular evidence indicates that many seed-transmitted endophytes are interspecific hybrids. Superinfection may result in hyphal fusion and parasexual recombination. Most endophytes produce one or more alkaloid classes that likely play some role in defending the host plant against pests. Hybridization may have led to the proliferation of alkaloid-production genes among asexual endophytes, favoring hybrids. The ergot alkaloid ergovaline, lolitrems, and lolines are produced by only a single sexual species, Epichloë festucae, but they are common in seed-transmitted endophytes, suggesting that E. festucae contributed genes for their synthesis. Asexual hybrids may also be favored by the counteracting of the accumulation of deleterious mutations (Muller's rachet). Endophyte infection can provide other benefits, such as enhanced drought tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and growth. Estimates of infection frequency have revealed variable levels of infection with especially high prevalence in the subfamily Pooideae. Longitudinal studies suggest that the prevalence of seed-transmitted endophytes can increase rapidly over time. In field experiments, infected tall fescue suppressed other grasses and forbs relative to uninfected fescue and supported lower consumer populations. Unlike other widespread plant/microbial symbioses based on the acquisition of mineral resources, grass/endophyte associations are based primarily on protection of the host from biotic and abiotic stresses.},

The importance of such interactions in the immune response, signal transduction cascades, and gene expression cannot be overstated. It is of great interest to determine the nature of the forces that stabilize the interaction. The thermodynamics of association are characterized by the stoichiometry of the interaction (n), the association constant (Ka), the free energy ([Delta]Gb), enthalpy ([Delta]Hb), entropy ([Delta]Sb), and heat capacity of binding ([Delta]Cp). In combination with structural information, the energetics of binding can provide a complete dissection of the interaction and aid in identifying the most important regions of the interface and the energetic contributions. Various indirect methods ({ELISA}, {RIA}, surface plasmon resonance, etc.) are routinely used to characterize biologically important interactions. Here we describe the use of isothermal titration calorimetry ({ITC}) in the study of protein-protein interactions. {ITC} is the most quantitative means available for measuring the thermodynamic properties of a protein-protein interaction. {ITC} measures the binding equilibrium directly by determining the heat evolved on association of a ligand with its binding partner. In a single experiment, the values of the binding constant (Ka), the stoichiometry (n), and the enthalpy of binding ([Delta]Hb) are determined. The free energy and entropy of binding are determined from the association constant. The temperature dependence of the [Delta]Hb parameter, measured by performing the titration at varying temperatures, describes the [Delta]Cp term. As a practical application of the method, we describe the use of {ITC} to study the interaction between cytochrome c and two monoclonal antibodies.},

Endophytes associated with leaves of tropical plants are an especially exciting and relatively untapped source of novel compounds. However, one major challenge in drug discovery lies in developing strategies to efficiently recover highly bioactive strains. As part of a 15-year drug discovery project, foliar endophytes were isolated from 3198 plant samples (51 orders, 105 families and at least 232 genera of angiosperms and ferns) collected in nine geographically distinct regions of Panama. Extracts from culture supernatants of {\textgreater}2700 isolates were tested for bioactivity (in vitro percent inhibition of growth, \% {IG}) against a human breast cancer cell line ({MCF}-7) and the causative agents of malaria, leishmaniasis, and Chagas' disease. Overall, 32.7\% of endophyte isolates were highly active in at least one bioassay, including representatives of diverse fungal lineages, host lineages, and collection sites. Up to 17\% of isolates tested per assay were highly active. Most bioactive strains were active in only one assay. Fungal lineages differed in the incidence and degree of bioactivity, as did fungi from particular plant taxa, and greater bioactivity was observed in endophytes isolated from plants in cloud forests vs. lowland forests. Our results suggest that using host taxonomy and forest type to tailor plant collections, and selecting endophytes from specific orders or families for cultivation, will markedly increase the efficiency and efficacy of discovering bioactive metabolites for particular pharmaceutical targets.},

	abstract = {Plant diversity is considered one factor structuring soil fungal communities because the diversity of compounds in leaf litter might determine the extent of resource heterogeneity for decomposer communities. Lowland tropical rain forests have the highest plant diversity per area of any biome. Since fungi are responsible for much of the decomposition occurring in forest soils, understanding the factors that structure fungi in tropical forests may provide valuable insight for predicting changes in global carbon and nitrogen fluxes. To test the role of plant diversity in shaping fungal community structure and function, soil (0-20 cm) and leaf litter (O horizons) were collected from six established 1-ha forest census plots across a natural plant diversity gradient on the Isthmus of Panama. We used 454 pyrosequencing and phospholipid fatty acid analysis to evaluate correlations between microbial community composition, precipitation, soil nutrients, and plant richness. In soil, the number of fungal taxa increased significantly with increasing mean annual precipitation, but not with plant richness. There were no correlations between fungal communities in leaf litter and plant diversity or precipitation, and fungal communities were found to be compositionally distinct between soil and leaf litter. To directly test for effects of plant species richness on fungal diversity and function, we experimentally re-created litter diversity gradients in litter bags with 1, 25, and 50 species of litter. After 6 months, we found a significant effect of litter diversity on decomposition rate between one and 25 species of leaf litter. However, fungal richness did not track plant species richness. Although studies in a broader range of sites is required, these results suggest that precipitation may be a more important factor than plant diversity or soil nutrient status in structuring tropical forest soil fungal communities.},

The need to search for these fuels arises mainly from the standpoint of preserving the global environment and the concern about long-term supplies of conventional hydrocarbon-based diesel fuels. Among the different possible sources, diesel fuels derived from triglycerides (vegetable oils/animal fats) present a promising alternative to substitute diesel fuels. Although triglycerides can fuel diesel engines, their high viscosities, low volatilities and poor cold flow properties have led to the investigation of various derivatives. Fatty acid methyl esters, known as biodiesel, derived from triglycerides by transesterification with methanol have received the most attention. The main advantages of using biodiesel are its renewability, better-quality exhaust gas emissions, its biodegradability and given that all the organic carbon present is photosynthetic in origin, it does not contribute to a rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and consequently to the greenhouse effect.

	abstract = {An endophytic Hypoxylon sp. (strain {CI}-4) producing a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}), including 1,8-cineole, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane, 1,2,4-tris(methylene), was selected as a candidate for the modulation of {VOC} production. This was done in order to learn if the production of these and other {VOCs} can be affected by using agents that may modulate the epigenetics of the fungus. Many of the {VOCs} made by this organism are of interest because of their high energy densities and thus the potential they might have as Mycodiesel fuels. Strain {CI}-4 was exposed to the epigenetic modulators suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ({SAHA}, a histone deacetylase) and 5-azacytidine ({AZA}, a {DNA} methyltransferase inhibitor). After these treatments the organism displayed striking cultural changes, including variations in pigmentation, growth rates and odour, in addition to significant differences in the bioactivities of the {VOCs}. The resulting variants were designated {CI}4-B, {CI}4-{AZA} and {CI}4-{SAHA}. {GC}/{MS} analyses of the {VOCs} produced by the variants showed considerable variation, with the emergence of several compounds not previously observed in the wild-type, particularly an array of tentatively identified terpenes such as α-thujene, sabinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinolene and β-selinene, in addition to several primary and secondary alkanes, alkenes, organic acids and derivatives of benzene. Proton transfer reaction mass spectroscopic analyses showed a marked increase in the ratio of ethanol (mass 47) to the total mass of all other ionizable {VOCs}, from {\textasciitilde}0.6 in the untreated strain {CI}-4 to {\textasciitilde}0.8 in {CI}-4 grown in the presence of {AZA}. Strain {CI}4-B was created by exposure of the fungus to 100 µM {SAHA}; upon removal of the epigenetic modulator from the culture medium, it did not revert to the wild-type phenotype. Results of this study have implications for understanding why there may be a wide range of {VOCs} found in various isolates of this fungus in nature.},

The lipid acyl chain profile of the bacteria, altered by growing cells in steady state at 30, 37, 42, or 45�C, was determined by gas chromatography of the fatty acid methyl esters. In parallel experiments, total membranes obtained from cells of the above-mentioned cultures were labeled with dipyrenylpropane and their relative fluidity was measured on the basis of the excimer to monomer fluorescence intensity ratio of the fluorophore. It has been found that, at constant assay temperature, fluidity determined with dipyrenylpropane decreases gradually with the growth temperature increment, from 30 to 45�C. Interestingly, when fatty acid composition is taken into account, fluidity increases linearly in the range under study, with the proportion of unsaturated fatty acyl chains, both variables being highly correlated (0.924 {\textless}= r2 {\textless}= 0.996). Our results show that dipyrenylpropane is a reliable and quantitative indicator of changes in membrane fluidity, driven by modifications in the acyl chain composition of bacterial lipids.},

This fungus produces a mixture of volatile organic compounds ({VOC}'s) lethal to such plant pathogenic fungi as Pythium ultimum and Verticillum dahliae, while other pathogens were only inhibited by its volatiles. Some of the same volatile bioactive compounds exuded by Gliocladium sp. such as 1-butanol, 3-methyl-, phenylethyl alcohol and acetic acid, 2-phenylethyl ester, as well as various propanoic acid esters, are also produced by Muscodor albus, a well known volatile antimicrobial producer. In fact, M. albus was used as a selection tool to effectively isolate Gliocladium sp. since it is resistant to {VOC}'s produced by M. albus. However, the primary volatile compound produced by Gliocladium sp. is 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene or [8]annulene, which by itself, was an effective inhibitor of fungal growth. The authenticated {VOC}'s of Gliocladium sp. were inhibitory to all, and lethal to some test fungi in a manner that nearly mimicked the gases of Gliocladium sp. itself. This report shows that the production of selective volatile antibiotics by endophytic fungi is not exclusively confined to the Muscodor spp.},

	doi = {10.1126/science.175.4023.720},
	abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands.Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of {SV}40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37\{degrees\}C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0\{degrees\}C instead of 37\{degrees\}C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

Because microbial abundance and diversity might differ in pregnancy, we sought to generate comparative metagenomic signatures across gestational age strata. {DNA} was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the V5V3 region of bacterial 16S {rRNA} genes were sequenced (454FLX Titanium platform). Sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). Generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units ({OTU}); principal coordinates analysis ({PCoA}) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. Altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing {\textgreater}2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837 sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses. Although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix {pH} {\textgreater}4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific {OTUs} and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of Lactobacillus species (L. iners crispatus, jensenii and johnsonii, and the orders Lactobacillales (and Lactobacillaceae family), Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Actinomycetales. This intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16S {rRNA} gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age.},

Here, we provide a functional analysis of two major homologues of the velvet complex in P. chrysogenum, which we have named P. chrysogenum {velA} ({PcvelA}) and {PclaeA}. Data from array analysis using a \{Delta\}{PcvelA} deletion strain indicate a significant role of {PcVelA} on the expression of biosynthesis and developmental genes, including {PclaeA}. Northern hybridization and high-performance liquid chromatography quantifications of penicillin titers clearly show that both {PcVelA} and {PcLaeA} play a major role in penicillin biosynthesis in a producer strain that underwent several rounds of {UV} mutagenesis during a strain improvement program. Both regulators are further involved in different developmental processes. While {PcvelA} deletion leads to light-independent conidial formation, dichotomous branching of hyphae, and pellet formation in shaking cultures, a \{Delta\}{PclaeA} strain shows a severe impairment in conidiophore formation under both light and dark conditions. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays provide evidence for a velvet-like complex in P. chrysogenum, with structurally conserved components that have distinct developmental roles, illustrating the functional plasticity of these regulators in genera other than Aspergillus.},

Toward this goal, the {HMP} has characterized the microbial communities at 18 body habitats in a cohort of over 200 healthy volunteers using 16S {rRNA} gene (16S) sequencing and has generated nearly 1,000 reference genomes from human-associated microorganisms. To determine how well current reference genome collections capture the diversity observed among the healthy microbiome and to guide isolation and future sequencing of microbiome members, we compared the {HMP}'s 16S data sets to several reference 16S collections to create a 'most wanted' list of taxa for sequencing. Our analysis revealed that the diversity of commonly occurring taxa within the {HMP} cohort microbiome is relatively modest, few novel taxa are represented by these {OTUs} and many common taxa among {HMP} volunteers recur across different populations of healthy humans. Taken together, these results suggest that it should be possible to perform whole-genome sequencing on a large fraction of the human microbiome, including the 'most wanted', and that these sequences should serve to support microbiome studies across multiple cohorts. Also, in stark contrast to other taxa, the 'most wanted' organisms are poorly represented among culture collections suggesting that novel culture- and single-cell-based methods will be required to isolate these organisms for sequencing.},

	abstract = {Abstract  We have recently shown (Chang et al., 1995) that lipid-channel interactions, exemplified by the effects of cholesterol on the calcium-activated potassium ({BK}) channel, profoundly affect channel properties. The present study further explores such interactions by monitoring changes in {BK} channel behavior after reconstitution into bilayers where the size of phospholipid ({PL}) headgroups is increased and where the freedom of motion (inverse order) of fatty acid chains is incremented. Increasing the {PL} headgroup cross-sectional area, from that of N-meth-{DOPE} to that of {DOPC} (an increase from ca. 60 to 70 Å2), is associated with a doubling of the channel mean opentime. Channel conductance, however, was unaffected. Increasing the order of the fatty acid chains, from that of {DOPE} to {POPE} and to that of {DEPE}, had no significant effect on channel properties (at 22°C). We interpret the changes reported here to reflect lipid-protein interactions through the induction of structural stress related to the headgroup structures of phospholipids.},

	abstract = {In a number of cases, the function of membrane proteins appears to require the presence of specific lipid species in the bilayer. We have shown that the secondary multidrug transporter {LmrP} requires the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine ({PE}), as its replacement by phosphatidylcholine ({PC}) inhibits transport activity and directly affects its structure, although the underlying mechanism was unknown. Here, we show that the effect of {PE} on the structure and the function of {LmrP} is mediated by interactions between the lipid headgroup and the protein. We used methyl-{PE} and dimethyl-{PE} analogs of {PE} to show that only replacement of the three hydrogens by methyl moieties leads to changes in the biochemical and biophysical properties of the reconstituted protein. This suggests that {LmrP} does not depend on the bulk properties of the phospholipids tested but solely on the hydrogen bonding ability of the headgroup. We then show that a single point mutation in {LmrP}, D68C, is sufficient to recapitulate precisely every biochemical and biophysical effect observed when {PE} is replaced by {PC}, including energy transfer between the protein tryptophan residues and the lipid headgroups. We conclude that the negatively charged Asp-68 is likely to participate in the interaction with {PE} and that such interaction is required for proton gradient sensing, substrate binding, and transport. Because Asp-68 belongs to a highly conserved motif in the Major Facilitator Superfamily (which includes {LacY} and {EmrD}), this interaction might be a general feature of these transporters that is involved in proton gradient sensing and lipid dependence.},

	abstract = {{EmrE} is a small multidrug transporter in Escherichia coli that extrudes various positively charged drugs across the plasma membrane in exchange with protons, thereby rendering cells resistant to these compounds. Biochemical experiments indicate that the basic functional unit of {EmrE} is a dimer where the common binding site for protons and substrate is formed by the interaction of an essential charged residue (Glu14) from both {EmrE} monomers. Previous studies implied that other residues in the vicinity of Glu14 are part of the binding domain. Alkylation of Cys replacements in the same transmembrane domain inhibits the activity of the protein and this inhibition is fully prevented by substrates of {EmrE}. To monitor directly the reaction we tested also the extent of modification using fluorescein-5-maleimide. While most residues are not accessible or only partially accessible, four, Y4C, I5C, L7C, and A10C, were modified at least 80\%. Furthermore, preincubation with tetraphenylphosphonium reduces the reaction of two of these residues by up to 80\%. To study other essential residues we generated functional hetero-oligomers and challenged them with various methane thiosulfonates. Taken together the findings imply the existence of a binding cavity accessible to alkylating reagents where at least three residues from {TM}1, Tyr40 from {TM}2, and Trp63 in {TM}3 are involved in substrate binding.},

There are few substantive methods to measure the health of the immune system, and the connection between immune strength and the viral component of the microbiome is poorly understood. Organ transplant recipients are treated with posttransplant therapies that combine immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs, offering a window into the effects of immune modulation on the virome. We used sequencing of cell-free {DNA} in plasma to investigate drug-virome interactions in a cohort of organ transplant recipients (656 samples, 96 patients) and find that antivirals and immunosuppressants strongly affect the structure of the virome in plasma. We observe marked virome compositional dynamics at the onset of the therapy and find that the total viral load increases with immunosuppression, whereas the bacterial component of the microbiome remains largely unaffected. The data provide insight into the relationship between the human virome, the state of the immune system, and the effects of pharmacological treatment and offer a potential application of the virome state to predict immunocompetence.},

After 4 days of treatment, Golgi membranes and liposomes prepared from treated rats were found to possess a greater fluidity than their control (diluent or 0.9\% {NaCl}) counterpart, as assessed by steady-state fluorescence-polarization techniques using three different fluorophores. Moreover, analysis of the effects of temperature on the anisotropy values of 1,6-diphenylhexa-1,3,5-triene, using Arrhenius plots, demonstrated that the mean break-point temperatures of treated preparations were 4-5 degrees C lower than those of control preparations. Changes in the fatty acyl saturation index and double-bond index of treated membranes, secondary to alterations in stearic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, at least in part, appeared to be responsible for the differences in fluidity noted between treated and control Golgi membranes. Concomitant with these fluidity and lipid-compositional alterations, treated membranes possessed higher specific activities of {UDP}-galactosyl-lactosylceramide galactosyltransferase and {CMP}-N-acetylneuraminic acid:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase than their control counterparts. Experiments utilizing benzyl alcohol, a known fluidizer, furthermore suggested that the fluidity alteration induced by dexamethasone may be responsible for the increased activity of the former, but not the latter, glycosphingolipid glycosyltransferase.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: {PSORTb} has remained the most precise bacterial protein subcellular localization ({SCL}) predictor since it was first made available in 2003. However, the recall needs to be improved and no accurate {SCL} predictors yet make predictions for archaea, nor differentiate important localization subcategories, such as proteins targeted to a host cell or bacterial hyperstructures/organelles. Such improvements should preferably be encompassed in a freely available web-based predictor that can also be used as a standalone program.
{RESULTS}: We developed {PSORTb} version 3.0 with improved recall, higher proteome-scale prediction coverage, and new refined localization subcategories. It is the first {SCL} predictor specifically geared for all prokaryotes, including archaea and bacteria with atypical membrane/cell wall topologies. It features an improved standalone program, with a new batch results delivery system complementing its web interface. We evaluated the most accurate {SCL} predictors using 5-fold cross validation plus we performed an independent proteomics analysis, showing that {PSORTb} 3.0 is the most accurate but can benefit from being complemented by Proteome Analyst predictions.

Additionally, {TMHMM} can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 \%, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 \% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with Nin-Cin topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for Nout-Cin topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms.

We have identified a pair of cis-interfering {ncRNAs} in yeast that contribute to the control of variegated gene expression at the {FLO}11 locus by implementing a regulatory circuit that toggles between two stable states. These capped, polyadenylated {ncRNAs} are transcribed across the large intergenic region upstream of the {FLO}11 {ORF}. As with mammalian long intervening (li){ncRNAs}, these yeast {ncRNAs} ({ICR}1 and {PWR}1) are themselves regulated by transcription factors (Sfl1 and Flo8) and chromatin remodelers (Rpd3L) that are key elements in phenotypic transitions in yeast. The mechanism that we describe explains the unanticipated role of a histone deacetylase complex in activating gene expression, because Rpd3L mutants force the {ncRNA} circuit into a state that silences the expression of the adjacent variegating gene.},

Volatile compound screening of a fungal endophyte collection revealed a number of isolates in the family Xylariaceae, producing a series of terpene molecules including 1,8-cineole. This compound is a commercially important component of eucalyptus oil used in pharmaceutical applications and has been explored as a potential biofuel additive. The genes that produce terpene molecules such as 1,8-cineole have been little explored in fungi, providing an opportunity to explore the biosynthetic origin of these compounds. Through genome sequencing of cineole producing isolate E7406B we were able to identify eleven new terpene synthase genes. Expressing a subset of these genes in E. coli allowed identification of the hyp3 gene, responsible for 1,8-cineole biosynthesis, the first monoterpene synthase discovered in fungi. In a striking example of convergent evolution, mutational analysis of this terpene synthase revealed an active site asparagine critical for water capture and specificity during cineole synthesis, the same mechanism used in an unrelated plant homologue. These studies have provided insight into the evolutionary relationship of fungal terpene synthases to those in plants and bacteria, and further established fungi as a relatively untapped source of this important and diverse class of compounds.},

Ultimately, these compounds, once isolated and characterized, may also have potential for use in modern medicine, agriculture, and industry. Novel antibiotics, antimycotics, immunosuppressants, and anticancer compounds are only a few examples of what has been found after the isolation and culturing of individual endophytes followed by purification and characterization of some of their natural products. The prospects of finding new drugs that may be effective candidates for treating newly developing diseases in humans, plants, and animals are great.

Mathematical analyses, including principal component analysis and batch-learning self-organizing map analysis of transcriptome and metabolome data suggested the presence of general responses to sulfur and nitrogen deficiencies. In addition, specific responses to either sulfur or nitrogen deficiency were observed in several metabolic pathways: in particular, the genes and metabolites involved in glucosinolate metabolism were shown to be coordinately modulated. Understanding such gene-to-metabolite networks in primary and secondary metabolism through integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics can lead to identification of gene function and subsequent improvement of production of useful compounds in plants.},

However, recent evidence indicates that normal intestinal microbiota might also positively influence immune responses, and protect against the development of inflammatory diseases. One of these elements may be short-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}), which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibre by intestinal microbiota. A feature of human ulcerative colitis and other colitic diseases is a change in 'healthy' microbiota such as Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes , and a concurrent reduction in {SCFAs}. Moreover, increased intake of fermentable dietary fibre, or {SCFAs}, seems to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of colitis. {SCFAs} bind the G-protein-coupled receptor 43 ({GPR}43, also known as {FFAR}2), and here we show that {SCFA}–{GPR}43 interactions profoundly affect inflammatory responses. Stimulation of {GPR}43 by {SCFAs} was necessary for the normal resolution of certain inflammatory responses, because {GPR}43-deficient (Gpr43-/-) mice showed exacerbated or unresolving inflammation in models of colitis, arthritis and asthma. This seemed to relate to increased production of inflammatory mediators by Gpr43-/- immune cells, and increased immune cell recruitment. Germ-free mice, which are devoid of bacteria and express little or no {SCFAs}, showed a similar dysregulation of certain inflammatory responses. {GPR}43 binding of {SCFAs} potentially provides a molecular link between diet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism, and immune and inflammatory responses.},

The ternary phase equilibrium data for the system water-petrol-ethanol were determined over the whole composition range at 0 and 25 °C; the addition of about 5\% 1,8-cineole to petrol increased the single-phase area by more than 11\%.

Harnessing the Ehrlich pathway of yeasts by bioconversion of L-phenylalanine to 2-{PE} could be an option, but in situ product removal is necessary due to product inhibition. This review describes the microbial production of 2-{PE}, and also summarizes the chemical syntheses and the market situation.},

 Soil harbors a diverse spectrum of bacteria that secrete small molecules such as antibiotics. Streptomyces bacteria, considered the most prolific producers, have been mined for decades for novel products with therapeutic applications, yet little is known about the properties of the interaction networks these compounds mediate. These networks can hold clues about how the diversity of small molecules and of Streptomyces strains with different production and resistance capabilities is maintained and promoted. To explore the network properties, we developed a high-throughput platform for measuring pairwise phenotypic interactions mediated by secreted metabolites, and used it to measure the interaction network among 64 random Streptomyces isolates from several grains of soil. We found many strong but specific interactions that are on average determined more by metabolite production than by metabolite sensitivity. We found reciprocity between strains, whereby if one strain inhibits or promotes the growth of a second strain, it's likely that the second strain affects the first strain in a similar manner. These interactions are not correlated with phylogeny, as very closely related strains exhibit different interaction patterns. We could explain these findings with a mathematical model requiring interplay between ecological dynamics and evolution of antibiotic production and resistance, suggesting that the bacterial and small molecule diversity of these communities is maintained by constant evolutionary turnover of interaction phenotypes.},

Since all metabolites maintained the radioisotope label at 1-C, they were produced by a pathway in which the carbon structure was retained, i.e., a reduction pathway.

These loci remain dormant until appropriate chemical or physical signals induce their expression. Here we demonstrate the use of a high-throughput genome scanning method to detect and analyze gene clusters involved in natural-product biosynthesis. This method was applied to uncover biosynthetic pathways encoding enediyne antitumor antibiotics in a variety of actinomycetes. Comparative analysis of five biosynthetic loci representative of the major structural classes of enediynes reveals the presence of a conserved cassette of five genes that includes a novel family of polyketide synthase ({PKS}). The enediyne {PKS} ({PKSE}) is proposed to be involved in the formation of the highly reactive chromophore ring structure (or "warhead") found in all enediynes. Genome scanning analysis indicates that the enediyne warhead cassette is widely dispersed among actinomycetes. We show that selective growth conditions can induce the expression of these loci, suggesting that the range of enediyne natural products may be much greater than previously thought. This technology can be used to increase the scope and diversity of natural-product discovery.},

Although their biosynthesis from fatty acyl precursors is well established, the last step of hydrocarbon biosynthesis from long-chain fatty aldehydes has remained mysterious. We show here that insects use a P450 enzyme of the {CYP}4G family to oxidatively produce hydrocarbons from aldehydes. Oenocyte-directed {RNAi} knock-down of Drosophila {CYP}4G1 or {NADPH}-cytochrome P450 reductase results in flies deficient in cuticular hydrocarbons, highly susceptible to desiccation, and with reduced viability upon adult emergence. The heterologously expressed enzyme converts C18-trideuterated octadecanal to C17-trideuterated heptadecane, showing that the insect enzyme is an oxidative decarbonylase that catalyzes the cleavage of long-chain aldehydes to hydrocarbons with the release of carbon dioxide. This process is unlike cyanobacteria that use a nonheme diiron decarbonylase to make alkanes from aldehydes with the release of formate.

Although virus infection is suspected to be the cause of most of these fevers, a comprehensive analysis of viruses in samples from children with fever and healthy controls is important for establishing a relationship between viruses and {UF}. We used unbiased, deep sequencing to analyze 176 nasopharyngeal swabs ({NP}) and plasma samples from children with {UF} and afebrile controls, generating an average of 4.6 million sequences per sample. An analysis pipeline was developed to detect viral sequences, which resulted in the identification of sequences from 25 viral genera. These genera included expected pathogens, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and roseoloviruses, plus viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Viruses that were unexpected in {NP} and plasma samples, such as the astrovirus {MLB}-2, were also detected. Sequencing allowed identification of virus subtype for some viruses, including roseoloviruses. Highly sensitive {PCR} assays detected low levels of viruses that were not detected in approximately 5 million sequences, but greater sequencing depth improved sensitivity. On average {NP} and plasma samples from febrile children contained 1.5- to 5-fold more viral sequences, respectively, than samples from afebrile children. Samples from febrile children contained a broader range of viral genera and contained multiple viral genera more frequently than samples from children without fever. Differences between febrile and afebrile groups were most striking in the plasma samples, where detection of viral sequence may be associated with a disseminated infection. These data indicate that virus infection is associated with {UF}. Further studies are important in order to establish the range of viral pathogens associated with fever and to understand of the role of viral infection in fever. Ultimately these studies may improve the medical treatment of children with {UF} by helping avoid antibiotic therapy for children with viral infections.},

It is thought that the selectivity of the drug binding site in {EmrE} is defined by two negatively charged glutamate residues within a hydrophobic pocket formed from six of the alpha-helices, three from each monomer of the asymmetric {EmrE} homodimer. It is not apparent how such a binding pocket accommodates drugs of various sizes and shapes or whether the conformational changes that occur upon drug binding are identical for drugs of diverse chemical nature. Here, using electron cryomicroscopy of {EmrE} two-dimensional crystals we have determined projection structures of {EmrE} bound to three structurally different planar drugs, ethidium, propidium and dequalinium. Using image analysis and rigorous comparisons between these density maps and the density maps of the ligand-free and {TPP}+-bound forms of {EmrE}, we identify regions within the transporter that adapt differentially depending on the type of ligand bound. We show that all three planar drugs bind at the same pocket within the protein as {TPP}+. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that, while retaining the overall fold of the protein, binding of the planar drugs is accompanied by small rearrangements of the transmembrane domains that are different to those that occur when {TPP}+ binds. The regions in the {EmrE} dimer that are remodelled surround the drug binding site and include transmembrane domains from both monomers.},

A volatile compound(s) produced by these high-density conditions also inhibited mycelial growth of different species of fungi belonging to a variety of genera, suggesting a broad action range. The heat-stable compound was isolated by successive centrifugation of the supernatant obtained from spore suspensions with a density of 109 conidia ml−1. By using static headspace analyses, two major peaks were distinguished, with the highest production of these metabolites after 22 h of incubation at 25°C and shaking at 140 rpm. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectra analysis revealed the compounds to be 3-octanone and 1-octen-3-ol. Notably, only the latter compound appeared to block the germination process at different developmental stages of the conidia (swelling and germ tube formation). In this study, 1-octen-3-ol influenced different developmental processes during the P. paneum life cycle, including induction of microcycle conidiation and inhibition of spore germination. Therefore, the compound can be considered a fungal hormone during fungal development.},

A new isolate, E-6, of this organism, with unusual biochemical and biological properties, has been obtained from the branches of a mature Guazuma ulmifolia (Sterculiaceae) tree growing in a dry tropical forest in {SW} Ecuador. This unique organism produces many {VOCs} not previously observed in other M. albus isolates, including butanoic acid, 2-methyl-; butanoic acid, 3-methyl-; 2-butenal, 2-methyl-; butanoic acid, 3-methylbutyl ester; 3-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl; guaiol; 1-octene, 3-ethyl-; formamide, N-(1-methylpropyl); and certain azulene and naphthalene derivatives. Some compounds usually seen in other M. albus isolates also appeared in the {VOCs} of isolate E-6, including caryophyllene; phenylethyl alcohol; acetic acid, 2-phenylethyl ester; bulnesene; and various propanoic acid, 2-methyl- derivatives. The biological activity of the {VOCs} of E-6 appears different from the original isolate of this fungus, {CZ}-620, since a Gram-positive bacterium was killed, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Rhizoctonia solani were not. Scanning electron micrographs of the mycelium of isolate E-6 showed substantial intertwining of the hyphal strands. These strands seemed to be held together by an extracellular matrix accounting for the strong mat-like nature of the mycelium, which easily lifts off the agar surface upon transfer, unlike any other isolate of this fungus. The {ITS}-5.8S {rDNA} partial sequence data showed 99 \% similarity to the original M. albus strain {CZ}-620. For the first time, successful establishment of M. albus into its natural host, followed by recovery of the fungus, was accomplished in seedlings of G. ulmifolia. Overall, isolates of M. albus, including E-6, have chemical, biological and structural characteristics that make them potentially useful in medicine, agricultural and industrial applications.},

In a recent outbreak investigation of intestinal mucormycosis due to Rhizopus microsporus infection in patients with hematological malignancies, {PCR} of the {ITS} of four of the 28 R. microsporus strains, P11, P12, D3-1, and D4-1, showed thick bands at about 700 bp. Direct sequencing of the purified bands showed frequent double peaks along all of the sequence traces and occasional triple peaks for P12, D3-1, and D4-1. The thick bands of the four R. microsporus strains were purified and cloned. Sequencing of 10 clones for each strain revealed two different {ITS} sequences for P11 and three different {ITS} sequences for P12, D3-1, and D4-1. Variations in {ITS} sequence among the different ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA}) operons in the same strain were observed in only {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 and not the 5.8S {rDNA} region. One copy of P11, P12, and D4-1, respectively, and one copy of P11, P12, D3-1, and D4-1, respectively, showed identical sequences. This represents the first evidence of {ITS} sequence heterogeneity in Mucorales. {ITS} sequence heterogeneity is an obstacle to molecular identification and genotyping of fungi in clinical microbiology laboratories. When thick bands and double peaks are observed during {PCR} sequencing of a gene target, such a strain should be sent to reference laboratories proficient in molecular technologies for further identification and/or genotyping.},

A well-known and important member of this family is the polycyclic diterpenoid Taxol (paclitaxel), which promotes tubulin polymerization and shows remarkable efficacy in cancer chemotherapy. The first committed step of Taxol biosynthesis in the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) is the cyclization of the linear isoprenoid substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate ({GGPP}) to form taxa-4(5),11(12)diene, which is catalysed by taxadiene synthase. The full-length form of this diterpene cyclase contains 862 residues, but a roughly 80-residue amino-terminal transit sequence is cleaved on maturation in plastids. We now report the X-ray crystal structure of a truncation variant lacking the transit sequence and an additional 27 residues at the N terminus, hereafter designated {TXS}. Specifically, we have determined structures of {TXS} complexed with 13-aza-13,14-dihydrocopalyl diphosphate (1.82 Å resolution) and 2-fluorogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (2.25 Å resolution). The {TXS} structure reveals a modular assembly of three α-helical domains. The carboxy-terminal catalytic domain is a class I terpenoid cyclase, which binds and activates substrate {GGPP} with a three-metal ion cluster. The N-terminal domain and a third ‘insertion’ domain together adopt the fold of a vestigial class {II} terpenoid cyclase. A class {II} cyclase activates the isoprenoid substrate by protonation instead of ionization, and the {TXS} structure reveals a definitive connection between the two distinct cyclase classes in the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis.},

They are heavily used in industry, and the trend is toward engineering modified microorganisms that produce high levels of specific terpenoids. Most studies have focused on creating specific heterologous pathways for sesquiterpenes in Escherichia coli or yeast. We subjected the Saccharomyces cerevisiae {ERG}20 gene (encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase) to a set of amino acid mutations in the catalytic site at position K197. Mutated strains have been shown to exhibit various growth rate, sterol amount, and monoterpenol-producing capacities. These results are discussed in the context of the potential use of these mutated strains for heterologous expression of monoterpenoid synthases, which was investigated using Ocimum basilicum geraniol synthase.

Microbial communities are notoriously difficult to analyze because of their inaccessibility via culturing and high diversity. Next generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to obtain deep sampling coverage of the 16S {rRNA} gene; however, interpretation of the resulting data is complicated by the inability to relate sequences from variable regions within the gene to the full-length gene and ultimately, the parent genome. Here, I present a comprehensive analysis quantifying the effects of varying sequence alignment quality, pairwise distances calculation methods, sequence filtering, and regions within the 16S {rRNA} gene on downstream analysis using {OTU}- and phylogeny-based methods. This analysis indicates that each factor can have a significant effect on descriptions of α- and β-diversity. Because it is not possible to relate pyrotags to full-length 16S {rRNA} gene sequences directly, I encourage scientists to view pyrotags as markers within a microbiome in an analogous fashion to how geneticists view single nucleotide polymorphisms as markers within genomes.},

In yeast it occurs exclusively as an intermediate of farnesyl diphosphate synthesis. In the present study we investigated the potential use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an alternative engineering tool. The expression of geraniol synthase of Ocimum basilicum in yeast allowed a strong and specific excretion of geraniol to the growth medium, in contrast to mutants defective in farnesyl diphosphate synthase which excreted geraniol and linalool in similar amounts. A further increase of geraniol synthesis was obtained using yeast mutants defective in farnesyl diphosphate synthase. We also showed that geraniol synthase expression affects the general ergosterol pathway, but in a manner dependent on the genetic background of the strain.},

Included were a promoterless egfp vector for monitoring the expression of cloned promoters/enhancers in fungal cells and vectors for creating translation fusions to the N-terminus of {EGFP}. The vectors were further modified by introducing a variant hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene, lacking the commonly found {NcoI} site. Instead, this site, which contained an {ATG} start codon, was placed in front of the egfp gene and thus was made suitable for the cloning of translational fusions. The applicability of these vectors is demonstrated by analyzing transcription regulation and protein localization and secretion in two ascomycetes, Acremonium chrysogenum and Sordaria macrospora. In the latter, the heterologous egfp gene is stably inherited during meiotic divisions, as can easily be seen from fluorescent ascospores.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Type I polyketide synthases ({PKSs}), and related fatty acid synthases ({FASs}), represent a large group of proteins encoded by a diverse gene family that occurs in eubacteria and eukaryotes (mainly in fungi). Collectively, enzymes encoded by this gene family produce a wide array of polyketide compounds that encompass a broad spectrum of biological activity including antibiotic, antitumor, antifungal, immunosuppressive, and predator defense functional roles. We employed a phylogenomics approach to estimate relationships among members of this gene family from eubacterial and eukaryotic genomes. Our results suggest that some animal genomes (sea urchins, birds, and fish) possess a previously unidentified group of pks genes, in addition to possessing fas genes used in fatty acid metabolism. These pks genes in the chicken, fish, and sea urchin genomes do not appear to be closely related to any other animal or fungal genes, and instead are closely related to pks genes from the slime mold Dictyostelium and eubacteria. Continued accumulation of genome sequence data from diverse animal lineages is required to clarify whether the presence of these (non-fas) pks genes in animal genomes owes their origins to horizontal gene transfer (from eubacterial or Dictostelium genomes) or to more conventional patterns of vertical inheritance coupled with massive gene loss in several animal lineages. Additionally, results of our broad-scale phylogenetic analyses bolster the support for previous hypotheses of horizontal gene transfer of pks genes from bacterial to fungal and protozoan lineages.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A novel method to model and predict the location and orientation of alpha helices in membrane-spanning proteins is presented. It is based on a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) with an architecture that corresponds closely to the biological system. The model is cyclic with 7 types of states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The two loop paths on the non-cytoplasmic side are used to model short and long loops separately, which corresponds biologically to the two known different membrane insertions mechanisms. The close mapping between the biological and computational states allows us to infer which parts of the model architecture are important to capture the information that encodes the membrane topology, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints involved. Models were estimated both by maximum likelihood and a discriminative method, and a method for reassignment of the membrane helix boundaries were developed. In a cross validated test on single sequences, our transmembrane {HMM}, {TMHMM}, correctly predicts the entire topology for 77\% of the sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known topology. The same accuracy was achieved on a larger dataset of 160 proteins. These results compare favourably with existing methods.},

Advanced biofuels, such as long chain alcohols and isoprenoid- and fatty acid-based biofuels, have physical properties that more closely resemble petroleum-derived fuels, and as such are an attractive alternative for the future supplementation or replacement of petroleum-derived fuels. Here, we review recent developments in the engineering of metabolic pathways for the production of known and potential advanced biofuels by microorganisms.

Artificial mixtures of the fungal {VOCs} were both inhibitory and lethal to a number of human and plant pathogens, including three drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

	abstract = {Diabetes and obesity are two metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance and a low-grade inflammation. Seeking an inflammatory factor causative of the onset of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes, we have identified bacterial lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) as a triggering factor. We found that normal endotoxemia increased or decreased during the fed or fasted state, respectively, on a nutritional basis and that a 4-week high-fat diet chronically increased plasma {LPS} concentration two to three times, a threshold that we have defined as metabolic endotoxemia. Importantly, a high-fat diet increased the proportion of an {LPS}-containing microbiota in the gut. When metabolic endotoxemia was induced for 4 weeks in mice through continuous subcutaneous infusion of {LPS}, fasted glycemia and insulinemia and whole-body, liver, and adipose tissue weight gain were increased to a similar extent as in high-fat-fed mice. In addition, adipose tissue F4/80-positive cells and markers of inflammation, and liver triglyceride content, were increased. Furthermore, liver, but not whole-body, insulin resistance was detected in {LPS}-infused mice. {CD}14 mutant mice resisted most of the {LPS} and high-fat diet-induced features of metabolic diseases. This new finding demonstrates that metabolic endotoxemia dysregulates the inflammatory tone and triggers body weight gain and diabetes. We conclude that the {LPS}/{CD}14 system sets the tone of insulin sensitivity and the onset of diabetes and obesity. Lowering plasma {LPS} concentration could be a potent strategy for the control of metabolic diseases.},

Such an organism would require pathways for hydrocarbon production and the capacity to secrete sufficient enzymes to efficiently hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. To demonstrate how one might engineer and coordinate all of the necessary components for a biomass-degrading, hydrocarbon-producing microorganism, we engineered a microorganism naïve to both processes, Escherichia coli, to grow using both the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of several types of plant biomass pretreated with ionic liquids. Our engineered strains express cellulase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, and xylobiosidase enzymes under control of native E. coli promoters selected to optimize growth on model cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates. Furthermore, our strains grow using either the cellulose or hemicellulose components of ionic liquid-pretreated biomass or on both components when combined as a coculture. Both cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic strains were further engineered with three biofuel synthesis pathways to demonstrate the production of fuel substitutes or precursors suitable for gasoline, diesel, and jet engines directly from ionic liquid-treated switchgrass without externally supplied hydrolase enzymes. This demonstration represents a major advance toward realizing a consolidated bioprocess. With improvements in both biofuel synthesis pathways and biomass digestion capabilities, our approach could provide an economical route to production of advanced biofuels.},

	abstract = {• Premise of the study: Fungi are major decomposers in certain ecosystems and essential associates of many organisms. They provide enzymes and drugs and serve as experimental organisms. In 1991, a landmark paper estimated that there are 1.5 million fungi on the Earth. Because only 70000 fungi had been described at that time, the estimate has been the impetus to search for previously unknown fungi. Fungal habitats include soil, water, and organisms that may harbor large numbers of understudied fungi, estimated to outnumber plants by at least 6 to 1. More recent estimates based on high-throughput sequencing methods suggest that as many as 5.1 million fungal species exist.
• Methods: Technological advances make it possible to apply molecular methods to develop a stable classification and to discover and identify fungal taxa.
• Key results: Molecular methods have dramatically increased our knowledge of Fungi in less than 20 years, revealing a monophyletic kingdom and increased diversity among early-diverging lineages. Mycologists are making significant advances in species discovery, but many fungi remain to be discovered.
• Conclusions: Fungi are essential to the survival of many groups of organisms with which they form associations. They also attract attention as predators of invertebrate animals, pathogens of potatoes and rice and humans and bats, killers of frogs and crayfish, producers of secondary metabolites to lower cholesterol, and subjects of prize-winning research. Molecular tools in use and under development can be used to discover the world’s unknown fungi in less than 1000 years predicted at current new species acquisition rates.},

	abstract = {Obtaining an unbiased view of the phylogenetic composition and functional diversity within a microbial community is one central objective of metagenomic analysis. New technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have dramatically reduced sequencing costs, to a level where metagenomic analysis may become a viable alternative to more-focused assessments of the phylogenetic (e.g., 16S {rRNA} genes) and functional diversity of microbial communities. To determine whether the short ([{\textasciitilde}]100 to 200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for the phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities, the results of {BLAST} and {COG} analyses were compared for long ([{\textasciitilde}]750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, {BLASTX} searches against the {GenBank} nr database found far fewer homologs within the short-sequence libraries. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short-read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in {BLASTX} homolog detection. Only in cases where the long-read sequence had a close homolog (low {BLAST} E-score) did the derived short-read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more-distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short-read sequences. Among {COG} hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72\% of the {COG} hits found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for the analysis of short sequences, the use of short-read-length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for the metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.},

Because of its essential biological role, unique biochemistry and structural organization and the absence in mammalian cells of most of its constitutive components, the cell wall is an attractive target for the development of new antifungal agents.

This modified pathway preferentially selects longer-chain substrates for catalysis, as compared to the non-recursive natural pathway, and can recursively catalyze five elongation cycles to synthesize bulk chemicals, such as 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and phenylpropanol directly from glucose. The “+1” chemistry is a valuable metabolic tool in addition to the “+5” chemistry and “+2” chemistry for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, fatty acids, or polyketides.},

	abstract = {Summary
The biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin ({NCS}) was localized to 130 kb continuous {DNA} from Streptomyces carzinostaticus {ATCC}15944 and confirmed by gene inactivation. {DNA} sequence analysis of 92 kb of the cloned region revealed 68 open reading frames ({ORFs}), 47 of which were determined to constitute the {NCS} cluster. Sequence analysis of the genes within the {NCS} cluster suggested {dNDP}-D-mannose as a precursor for the deoxy aminosugar, revealed two distinct type I polyketide synthases ({PKSs}), and supported a convergent model for {NCS} chromophore biosynthesis from the deoxy aminosugar, naphthoic acid, and enediyne core building blocks. These findings shed light into deoxysugar biosynthesis, further support the iterative type I {PKS} paradigm for enediyne core biosynthesis, and unveil a mechanism for microbial polycyclic aromatic polyketide biosynthesis by an iterative type I {PKS}.},

By combining 22 newly sequenced faecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries with previously published data sets, here we identify three robust clusters (referred to as enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent specific. We also confirmed the enterotypes in two published, larger cohorts, indicating that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host–microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers.},

We now use shotgun pyrosequencing to characterize {RNA} mutations and expression levels unique to malignant pleural mesotheliomas ({MPMs}) and not present in control tissues. On average, 266 Mb of {cDNA} were sequenced from each of four {MPMs}, from a control pulmonary adenocarcinoma ({ADCA}), and from normal lung tissue. Previously observed differences in {MPM} {RNA} expression levels were confirmed. Point mutations were identified by using criteria that require the presence of the mutation in at least four reads and in both {cDNA} strands and the absence of the mutation from sequence databases, normal adjacent tissues, and other controls. In the four {MPMs}, 15 nonsynonymous mutations were discovered: 7 were point mutations, 3 were deletions, 4 were exclusively expressed as a consequence of imputed epigenetic silencing, and 1 was putatively expressed as a consequence of {RNA} editing. Notably, each {MPM} had a different mutation profile, and no mutated gene was previously implicated in {MPM}. Of the seven point mutations, three were observed in at least one tumor from 49 other {MPM} patients. The mutations were in genes that could be causally related to cancer and included {XRCC}6, {PDZK}1IP1, {ACTR}1A, and {AVEN}.},

	abstract = {A biological community usually has a large number of species with relatively small abundances. When a random sample of individuals is selected and each individual is classified according to species identity, some rare species may not be discovered. This paper is concerned with the estimation of Shannon’s index of diversity when the number of species and the species abundances are unknown. The traditional estimator that ignores the missing species underestimates when there is a non-negligible number of unseen species. We provide a different approach based on unequal probability sampling theory because species have different probabilities of being discovered in the sample. No parametric forms are assumed for the species abundances. The proposed estimation procedure combines the Horvitz–Thompson (1952) adjustment for missing species and the concept of sample coverage, which is used to properly estimate the relative abundances of species discovered in the sample. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator works well under various abundance models even when a relatively large fraction of the species is missing. Three real data sets, two from biology and the other one from numismatics, are given for illustration.},

The ability of the activated samples to convert limonene to p-cymene was evaluated using a reaction time of 15 min at 80 °C. The sample prepared using 3M {HCl} at 95 °C for 30 min ({SD}-3M-95-30) offered the optimum combination of surface area (470 m2 g−1) and acidity (0.26 mmol g−1) and 95\% of the limonene was converted to product. About 15\% of the product mixture was p-cymene whilst non-volatile products and polymeric species made up 54\% of the product mixture. The presence of iron in the octahedral sheet of the {SD} bentonite appears responsible for the dehydrogenation activity. {TG}–{MS} analysis of acid activated samples, saturated with cyclohexylamine, reflected the dehydrogenation capabilities of the catalysts in that {SD}-3M-95-30 produced the most benzene and aniline as decomposition/transformation products.},

When introduced into Escherichia coli, this nonnatural biosynthetic pathway produces various long-chain alcohols with carbon number ranging from 5 to 8. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by optimizing the biosynthesis of the 6-carbon alcohol, (S)-3-methyl-1-pentanol.

The Human Microbiome Project collected and sequenced ca. 5,000 samples from 18 different body sites, including the airways, gut, skin, oral cavity and vagina. These data allowed the first assessment of significant patterns of co-presence and exclusion among human-associated bacteria. We combined sparse regression with an ensemble of similarity measures to predict microbial relationships within and between body sites. This captured known relationships in the dental plaque, vagina, and gut, and also predicted novel interactions involving members of under-characterized phyla such as {TM}7. We detected relationships necessary for plaque formation and differences in community composition among dominant members of the gut and vaginal microbiomes. Most relationships were strongly niche-specific, with only a few hub microorganisms forming links across multiple body areas. We also found that phylogenetic distance had a strong impact on the interaction type: closely related microorganisms co-occurred within the same niche, whereas most exclusive relationships occurred between more distantly related microorganisms. This establishes both the specific organisms and general principles by which microbial communities associated with healthy humans are assembled and maintained.},

Optimal fermentation conditions for 3-methyl-1-butanol concentration were found at {pH} 3.0 and 0\% {NaCl}. To identify genes encoding enzymes with major influence on product formation, a genome-wide gene expression analysis was carried out with S. cerevisiae cells grown at {pH} 3.0 (optimal for 3-methyl-1-butanol formation) and {pH} 5.0 (yeast cultivated under standard conditions). A subset of 747 genes was significantly induced or repressed when the {pH} was changed from {pH} 5.0 to 3.0.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The purpose of the present study was to continue the investigation of the membrane transport mechanisms of 20-(S)-camptothecin ({CPT}) in order to understand the possible role of membrane transporters on its oral bioavailability and disposition.{METHODS}:The intestinal transport kinetics of {CPT} were characterized using Caco-2 cells, {MDCKII} wild-type cells and {MDCKII} cells transfected with human P-glycoprotein ({PGP}) ({ABCB}1) or human multidrug resistance protein 2 ({MRP}2) ({ABCC}2). The effects of drug concentration, inhibitors and temperature on {CPT} directional permeability were determined.{RESULTS}:The absorptive (apical to basolateral) and secretory (basolateral to apical) permeabilities of {CPT} were found to be saturable. Reduced secretory {CPT} permeabilities with decreasing temperatures suggests the involvement of an active, transporter-mediated secretory pathway. In the presence of etoposide, the {CPT} secretory permeability decreased 25.6\%. However, inhibition was greater in the presence of {PGP} and of the breast cancer resistant protein inhibitor, {GF}120918 (52.5\%). The involvement of additional secretory transporters was suggested since the basolateral to apical permeability of {CPT} was not further reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of {GF}120918. To investigate the involvement of specific apically-located secretory membrane transporters, {CPT} transport studies were conducted using {MDCKII}/{PGP} cells and {MDCKII}/{MRP}2 cells. {CPT} carrier-mediated permeability was approximately twofold greater in {MDCKII}/{PGP} cells and {MDCKII}/{MRP}2 cells than in {MDCKII}/wild-type cells, while the apparent Km values were comparable in all three cell lines. The efflux ratio of {CPT} in {MDCKII}/{PGP} in the presence of 0.2 {muM} {GF}120918 was not completely reversed (3.36 to 1.49). However, the decrease in the efflux ratio of {CPT} in {MDCKII}/{MRP}2 cells (2.31 to 1.03) suggests that {CPT} efflux was completely inhibited by {MK}571, a potent inhibitor of the Multidrug Resistance Protein transporter family.{CONCLUSIONS}:The current results provide evidence that {PGP} and {MRP}2 mediate the secretory transport of {CPT} in vitro. However, the involvement of other transporters cannot be ruled out based on these studies. Since these transporters are expressed in the intestine, liver and kidney variations in their expression levels and/or regulation may be responsible for the erratic oral absorption and biliary excretion of {CPT} observed in human subjects.},

	abstract = {Wild-type Ralstonia eutropha H16 produces polyhydroxybutyrate ({PHB}) as an intracellular carbon storage material during nutrient stress in the presence of excess carbon. In this study, the excess carbon was redirected in engineered strains from {PHB} storage to the production of isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol (branched-chain higher alcohols). These branched-chain higher alcohols can directly substitute for fossil-based fuels and be employed within the current infrastructure. Various mutant strains of R. eutropha with isobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase activity, in combination with the overexpression of plasmid-borne, native branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway genes and the overexpression of heterologous ketoisovalerate decarboxylase gene, were employed for the biosynthesis of isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Production of these branched-chain alcohols was initiated during nitrogen or phosphorus limitation in the engineered R. eutropha. One mutant strain not only produced over 180 mg/L branched-chain alcohols in flask culture, but also was significantly more tolerant of isobutanol toxicity than wild-type R. eutropha. After the elimination of genes encoding three potential carbon sinks ({ilvE}, {bkdAB}, and {aceE}), the production titer improved to 270 mg/L isobutanol and 40 mg/L 3-methyl-1-butanol. Semicontinuous flask cultivation was utilized to minimize the toxicity caused by isobutanol while supplying cells with sufficient nutrients. Under this semicontinuous flask cultivation, the R. eutropha mutant grew and produced more than 14 g/L branched-chain alcohols over the duration of 50 days. These results demonstrate that R. eutropha carbon flux can be redirected from {PHB} to branched-chain alcohols and that engineered R. eutropha can be cultivated over prolonged periods of time for product biosynthesis.},

We therefore developed a framework for metagenomic variation analysis and applied it to 252 faecal metagenomes of 207 individuals from Europe and North America. Using 7.4 billion reads aligned to 101 reference species, we detected 10.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), 107,991 short insertions/deletions, and 1,051 structural variants. The average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism rates of 0.11 was more variable between gut microbial species than across human hosts. Subjects sampled at varying time intervals exhibited individuality and temporal stability of {SNP} variation patterns, despite considerable composition changes of their gut microbiota. This indicates that individual-specific strains are not easily replaced and that an individual might have a unique metagenomic genotype, which may be exploitable for personalized diet or drug intake.},

Whereas such data can be readily used for a wide range of biomedical applications, it has proven difficult to use them to generate high-quality de novo genome assemblies of large, repeat-rich vertebrate genomes. To date, the genome assemblies generated from such data have fallen far short of those obtained with the older (but much more expensive) capillary-based sequencing approach. Here, we report the development of an algorithm for genome assembly, {ALLPATHS}-{LG}, and its application to massively parallel {DNA} sequence data from the human and mouse genomes, generated on the Illumina platform. The resulting draft genome assemblies have good accuracy, short-range contiguity, long-range connectivity, and coverage of the genome. In particular, the base accuracy is high (≥99.95\%) and the scaffold sizes (N50 size = 11.5 Mb for human and 7.2 Mb for mouse) approach those obtained with capillary-based sequencing. The combination of improved sequencing technology and improved computational methods should now make it possible to increase dramatically the de novo sequencing of large genomes.

	abstract = {We present a 6-gene, 420-species maximum-likelihood phylogeny of Ascomycota, the largest phylum of Fungi. This analysis is the most taxonomically complete to date with species sampled from all 15 currently circumscribed classes. A number of superclass-level nodes that have previously evaded resolution and were unnamed in classifications of the Fungi are resolved for the first time. Based on the 6-gene phylogeny we conducted a phylogenetic informativeness analysis of all 6 genes and a series of ancestral character state reconstructions that focused on morphology of sporocarps, ascus dehiscence, and evolution of nutritional modes and ecologies. A gene-by-gene assessment of phylogenetic informativeness yielded higher levels of informativeness for protein genes ({RPB}1, {RPB}2, and {TEF}1) as compared with the ribosomal genes, which have been the standard bearer in fungal systematics. Our reconstruction of sporocarp characters is consistent with 2 origins for multicellular sexual reproductive structures in Ascomycota, once in the common ancestor of Pezizomycotina and once in the common ancestor of Neolectomycetes. This first report of dual origins of ascomycete sporocarps highlights the complicated nature of assessing homology of morphological traits across Fungi. Furthermore, ancestral reconstruction supports an open sporocarp with an exposed hymenium (apothecium) as the primitive morphology for Pezizomycotina with multiple derivations of the partially (perithecia) or completely enclosed (cleistothecia) sporocarps. Ascus dehiscence is most informative at the class level within Pezizomycotina with most superclass nodes reconstructed equivocally. Character-state reconstructions support a terrestrial, saprobic ecology as ancestral. In contrast to previous studies, these analyses support multiple origins of lichenization events with the loss of lichenization as less frequent and limited to terminal, closely related species.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Terpenoids constitute a large family of natural products, attracting commercial interest for a variety of uses as flavours, fragrances, drugs and alternative fuels. Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a versatile cell factory, as the precursors of terpenoid biosynthesis are naturally synthesized by the sterol biosynthetic pathway.
{RESULTS}: S. cerevisiae wild type yeast cells, selected for their capacity to produce high sterol levels were targeted for improvement aiming to increase production. Recyclable integration cassettes were developed which enable the unlimited sequential integration of desirable genetic elements (promoters, genes, termination sequence) at any desired locus in the yeast genome. The approach was applied on the yeast sterol biosynthetic pathway genes {HMG}2, {ERG}20 and {IDI}1 resulting in several-fold increase in plant monoterpene and sesquiterpene production. The improved strains were robust and could sustain high terpenoid production levels for an extended period. Simultaneous plasmid-driven co-expression of {IDI}1 and the {HMG}2 (K6R) variant, in the improved strain background, maximized monoterpene production levels. Expression of two terpene synthase enzymes from the sage species Salvia fruticosa and S. pomifera ({SfCinS}1, {SpP}330) in the modified yeast cells identified a range of terpenoids which are also present in the plant essential oils. Co-expression of the putative interacting protein {HSP}90 with cineole synthase 1 ({SfCinS}1) also improved production levels, pointing to an additional means to improve production.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Using the developed molecular tools, new yeast strains were generated with increased capacity to produce plant terpenoids. The approach taken and the durability of the strains allow successive rounds of improvement to maximize yields.},

	abstract = {A Nodulisporium sp. (Hypoxylon sp.) has been isolated as an endophyte of Thelypteris angustifolia (Broadleaf Leaf Maiden Fern) in a rainforest region of Central America. It has been identified both on the basis of its morphological characteristics and by scanning electron microscopy as well as {ITS} sequence analysis. The endophyte produces volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) that have both fuel (mycodiesel) and use for biological control of plant disease. When grown on potato dextrose agar, the organism uniquely produces a series of ketones, including acetone; 2-pentanone; 3-hexanone, 4-methyl; 3-hexanone, 2,4- dimethyl; 2-hexanone, 4-methyl, and 5-hepten, 2-one and these account for about 25\% of the total {VOCs}. The most abundant identified {VOC} was 1,8 cineole, which is commonly detected in this group of organisms. Other prominent {VOCs} produced by this endophyte include 1-butanol, 2- methyl, and phenylethanol alcohol. Moreover, of interest was the presence of cyclohexane, propyl, which is a common ingredient of diesel fuel. Furthermore, the {VOCs} of this isolate of Nodulisporium sp. were selectively active against a number of plant pathogens, and upon a 24 h exposure caused death to Phytophthora palmivora, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and 100\% inhibition to Phytophthora cinnamomi with only slight to no inhibition of the other pathogens that were tested. From this work, it is becoming increasingly apparent that each isolate of this endophytic Nodulisporium spp., including the Daldina sp. and Hypoxylon spp. teleomorphs, seems to produce its own unique set of {VOCs}.},

	abstract = {Monoterpene synthases (cyclases) catalyze the divalent metal ion-dependent transformation of geranyl pyrophosphate to representatives of the various monocyclic and bicyclic skeletal types by an electrophilic reaction mechanism involving coupled isomerization and cyclization steps. An analogue of the geranyl substrate, in which the terminal gem-dimethyl groups were joined to form a cyclopropyl function (6-cyclopropylidene-3E-methyl-hex-2-en-1-yl pyrophosphate) was shown to be a potent inhibitor of (-)-4S-limonene synthase from Mentha spicata and of several other monoterpene cyclases from diverse plant species. Inhibition was concentration and time dependent (pseudo-first-order kinetics), as well as absolutely contingent on the presence of the divalent metal ion cofactor. A double reciprocal plot of kinactivation versus inhibitor concentration gave an apparent Ki of approximately 0.3 [mu]M and a maximum rate of inactivation of about 0.3 min-1 with limonene synthase. As expected for an active-site-directed process, the natural substrate, geranyl pyrophosphate, afforded protection against inactivation by the cyclopropylidene analogue. Selectivity of the inhibition was demonstrated with [1-3H]6-cyclopropylidene-3E-methyl-hex-2-en-1-yl pyrophosphate by specific labeling of limonene synthase in crude enzyme extracts as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, radio-fluorography, and immunoblotting. The radioactive cyclase-inactivator complex was formed with 1:1 stoichiometry and was stable to extended dialysis and boiling in 2\% sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting irreversible covalent modification of the enzyme involving a chemical reaction between cyclase and inhibitor. Thermally denatured limonene synthase and synthase that had been inactivated with the histidine-directed reagent diethylpyrocarbonate or the cysteine-directed reagent p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (two reagents known to modify the active site of the enzyme and inhibit catalysis) were not labeled when treated with the [1-3H]-analogue, indicating that the functional enzyme was necessary to effect complex formation. All of the evidence is consistent with the analogue serving as a mechanism-based inactivator that must undergo both ionization-dependent isomerization and cyclization steps to reveal an allylic cation which alkylates the protein. In addition to furnishing supporting evidence for the electrophilic reaction sequence, this mechanism-based inactivator provides a powerful new approach for the examination of cyclase active sites.},

To ameliorate this limitation, over the past decade several genetically amenable microbes have been developed as heterologous hosts for polyketide biosynthesis. Here we review the state of the art as well as the difficulties associated with heterologous polyketide production.

It is present ubiquitously in bacteria, archaea, and eukarya and includes members that can function by solute uniport, solute/cation symport, solute/cation antiport and/or solute/solute antiport with inwardly and/or outwardly directed polarity. All homologous {MFS} protein sequences in the public databases as of January 1997 were identified on the basis of sequence similarity and shown to be homologous. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the occurrence of 17 distinct families within the {MFS}, each of which generally transports a single class of compounds. Compounds transported by {MFS} permeases include simple sugars, oligosaccharides, inositols, drugs, amino acids, nucleosides, organophosphate esters, Krebs cycle metabolites, and a large variety of organic and inorganic anions and cations. Protein members of some {MFS} families are found exclusively in bacteria or in eukaryotes, but others are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. All permeases of the {MFS} possess either 12 or 14 putative or established transmembrane [alpha]-helical spanners, and evidence is presented substantiating the proposal that an internal tandem gene duplication event gave rise to a primordial {MFS} protein prior to divergence of the family members. All 17 families are shown to exhibit the common feature of a well-conserved motif present between transmembrane spanners 2 and 3. The analyses reported serve to characterize one of the largest and most diverse families of transport proteins found in living organisms.},

Here we quantify geographic patterns of endemism-scaled richness (“endemism richness”) of vascular plants across 90 terrestrial biogeographic regions, including islands, worldwide and evaluate their congruence with terrestrial vertebrates. Endemism richness of plants and vertebrates is strongly related, and values on islands exceed those of mainland regions by a factor of 9.5 and 8.1 for plants and vertebrates, respectively. Comparisons of different measures of past and future human impact and land cover change further reveal marked differences between mainland and island regions. While island and mainland regions suffered equally from past habitat loss, we find the human impact index, a measure of current threat, to be significantly higher on islands. Projected land-cover changes for the year 2100 indicate that land-use-driven changes on islands might strongly increase in the future. Given their conservation risks, smaller land areas, and high levels of endemism richness, islands may offer particularly high returns for species conservation efforts and therefore warrant a high priority in global biodiversity conservation in this century.},

	abstract = {Microbial production of biofuel has attracted significant attention in recent years. The fatty acids are important precursors for the production of fuels and chemicals, and its biosynthesis is initiated by the conversion of acetyl-{CoA} to malonyl-{CoA} which requires acetyl-{CoA} as key substrate. Herein, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was proposed to be metabolically engineered for cytosol acetyl-{CoA} enhancement for fatty acid synthesis. By gene disruption strategy, idh1 and idh2 genes involved in citrate turnover in tricarboxylic acid cycle ({TCA} cycle) were disrupted and the citrate production level was increased to 4- and 5-times in mutant yeast strains. In order to convert accumulated citrate to cytosol acetyl-{CoA}, a heterologous {ATP}-citrate lyase ({ACL}) was overexpressed in yeast wild type and idh1,2 disrupted strains. The wild type strain expressing acl mainly accumulated saturated fatty acids: C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0 at levels about 20\%, 14\% and 27\%, respectively. Additionally, the idh1,2 disrupted strains expressing acl mainly accumulated unsaturated fatty acids. Specifically in Δidh1 strain expressing acl, 80\% increase in C16:1 and 60\% increase in C18:1 was detected. In Δidh2 strain expressing acl, 60\% increase in C16:1 and 45\% increase in C18:1 was detected. In Δidh1/2 strain expressing acl, there was 92\% increase in C16:1 and 77\% increase in C18:1, respectively. The increased fatty acids from our study may well be potential substrates for the production of hydrocarbon molecules as potential biofuels.},

However, although {AcrB} is a major multidrug exporter in Gram-negative organisms, the majority of bacterial drug exporters are major facilitator superfamily ({MFS}) drug transporters. As no crystal structures have been solved for {MFS} transporters, the alternative protein-engineering methods are still very useful for estimating structures and functions of drug/H+ antiporters.

Prevalent estimation methods are mainly based on directly summarizing alignment results or its variants; often result in biased and/or unstable estimates. We have developed a unified probabilistic framework (named {GRAMMy}) by explicitly modeling read assignment ambiguities, genome size biases and read distributions along the genomes. Maximum likelihood method is employed to compute Genome Relative Abundance of microbial communities using the Mixture Model theory ({GRAMMy}). {GRAMMy} has been demonstrated to give estimates that are accurate and robust across both simulated and real read benchmark datasets. We applied {GRAMMy} to a collection of 34 metagenomic read sets from four metagenomics projects and identified 99 frequent species (minimally 0.5\% abundant in at least 50\% of the data- sets) in the human gut samples. Our results show substantial improvements over previous studies, such as adjusting the over-estimated abundance for Bacteroides species for human gut samples, by providing a new reference-based strategy for metagenomic sample comparisons. {GRAMMy} can be used flexibly with many read assignment tools (mapping, alignment or composition-based) even with low-sensitivity mapping results from huge short-read datasets. It will be increasingly useful as an accurate and robust tool for abundance estimation with the growing size of read sets and the expanding database of reference genomes.},

Acetyl {CoA} carboxylase {ACC}1 and fatty acid synthases {FAS}1/{FAS}2 were overexpressed in wild-type and squalene-overproducing strains. {ACC}1 overexpression led to decreased fatty acid content in the squalene-overproducing strain (factor of 0.7), while sterols and squalene were increased (factor of 1.5). In the wild-type strain, {ACC}1 overexpression led to increased levels of both fatty acids and squalene/sterols (factors of 4.0 and 1.7, respectively). This parallel activation of the two pathways seems to be due to transcriptional co-regulation of {ACC}1 and {HMG}1. While {FAS}1 and {FAS}2 overexpression had no effect in the wild-type strain, {FAS}2 overexpression induced significant increase of sterols and squalene (factors of 7.2 and 1.3, respectively) and a concomitant decrease of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the squalene-overproducing strain (factor of 0.6). The microarray expression profiles showed that genes upregulated in {ACC}1-overexpressing strains are {FAS}1, {ERG}11, {ERG}28, {ERG}5, {ERG}2 and {ERG}20, supporting the observed increase of zymosterol and saturated fatty acids.

We have developed a simple screening method for the cellular activities of terpene synthases by scoring their substrate consumption based on the color loss of the cell harboring carotenoid pathways. We demonstrate that this method can be used to detect activities of various terpene synthase or prenyltransferase genes in a high-throughput manner, irrespective of the product type, enabling the mutation analysis and directed evolution of terpene synthases. We also report the possibility for substrate-specific screening system of terpene synthases by taking advantage of the substrate-size specificity of C-30 and C-40 carotenoid pathways.},

Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments.
Results: We describe {UCHIME}, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. {UCHIME} either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. {UCHIME} has better sensitivity than {ChimeraSlayer} (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, {UCHIME} de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus. {UCHIME} is {\textgreater}100× faster than Perseus and {\textgreater}1000× faster than {ChimeraSlayer}.

	abstract = {The Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/glucose transporter ({vSGLT}) is a bacterial member of the {SGLT} gene family. Wild-type and mutant {vSGLT} proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and transport activity was measured in intact cells and plasma membrane vesicles. Two cysteine-less {vSGLT} proteins exhibited sugar transport rates comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Six residues in two regions of {vSGLT} known to be of functional importance in {SGLT}1 were replaced individually with cysteine in the cysteine-less protein. Characterization of these single cysteine-substituted {vSGLTs} showed that two residues (Gly-151 and Gln-428) are essential for transport function, whereas the other four residues (Leu-147, Leu-149, Ala-423, and Gln-425) are not. 2-Aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate ({MTSEA}) blocked Na(+)/glucose transport by only the transporter bearing a cysteine at position 425 (Q425C). {MTSEA} inhibition was reversed by dithiothreitol and blocked by the presence of both Na(+) and d-glucose, indicating that conformational changes of the {vSGLT} protein are involved in Na(+)/glucose transport. A split version of {vSGLT} was generated by co-expression of the N-terminal (N(7)) and C-terminal (C(7)) halves of the transporter. The split {vSGLT} maintained Na(+)-dependent glucose transport activity. Chemical cross-linking of split {vSGLT}, with a cysteine in each N(7) and C(7) fragment, suggested that hydrophilic loops between helices 4 and 5 and between helices 10 and 11 are within 8 A of each other. We conclude that the mechanism of Na(+)/glucose transport by {vSGLT} is similar to mammalian {SGLTs} and that further studies on {vSGLT} will provide novel insight to the structure and function of this class of cotransporters.},

Despite this potential, nearly all renewable fuels and chemicals are now produced from edible resources, such as starch, sugars, and oils; the challenges imposed by notoriously recalcitrant and heterogeneous lignocellulosic feedstocks have made their production from nonfood biomass inefficient and uneconomical. Here, we report that N,N-dimethylacetamide ({DMA}) containing lithium chloride ({LiCl}) is a privileged solvent that enables the synthesis of the renewable platform chemical 5-hydroxymethylfurfural ({HMF}) in a single step and unprecedented yield from untreated lignocellulosic biomass, as well as from purified cellulose, glucose, and fructose. The conversion of cellulose into {HMF} is unabated by the presence of other biomass components, such as lignin and protein. Mechanistic analyses reveal that loosely ion-paired halide ions in {DMA}−{LiCl} are critical for the remarkable rapidity (1−5 h) and yield (up to 92\%) of this low-temperature (≤140 °C) process. The simplicity of this chemical transformation of lignocellulose contrasts markedly with the complexity of extant bioprocesses and provides a new paradigm for the use of biomass as a raw material for a renewable energy and chemical industries.},

Despite the known wealth of volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) from species of the plant and animal kingdom, in the past, less attention has been focused on volatiles of microorganisms. Although fast and affordable sequencing methods facilitate the detection of microbial diseases, however, the analysis of signature or fingerprint volatiles will be faster and easier. Microbial {VOCs} ({mVOCs}) are presently used as marker to detect human diseases, food spoilage or moulds in houses. Furthermore, {mVOCs} exhibited antagonistic potential against pathogens in vitro, but their biological roles in the ecosystems remain to be investigated. Information on volatile emission from bacteria and fungi is presently scattered in the literature, and no public and up-to-date collection on {mVOCs} is available.

In the {pSD}1 system, the target gene was designed to be transcribed as a chimeric {RNA} with enhanced green fluorescent protein ({eGFP}) {RNA}. This enabled us to efficiently screen the resulting transformants using {GFP} fluorescence as an indicator of gene silencing. A model study with the {eGFP} gene showed that {pSD}1-based vectors induced gene silencing via the {RNAi} pathway with slightly lower efficiency than did hairpin {eGFP} {RNA}-expressing vectors. To demonstrate the applicability of the {pSD}1 system for elucidating gene function in the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, 37 calcium signalling-related genes that include almost all known calcium-signalling proteins in the genome were targeted for gene silencing by the vector. Phenotypic analyses of the silenced transformants showed that at least 26, 35 and 15 of the 37 genes examined were involved in hyphal growth, sporulation and pathogenicity, respectively, in M.�oryzae. These included several novel findings such as that Pmc1-, Spf1- and Neo1-like Ca2+ pumps, calreticulin and calpactin heavy chain were essential for fungal pathogenicity.},

In all of them, the acyl or peptidyl carrier proteins have 4'-phosphopantetheine (P-pant) as an essential prosthetic group. This is added by 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases ({PPTases}) that derive the P-pant group from coenzyme A. While many {PPTases} of varying specificity have now been isolated from a number of bacteria, a filamentous fungal {PPTase} has yet to be characterised. Through database searching of the Aspergillus fumigatus genome sequence against Sfp from Bacillus subtilis, we identified a unique sequence which appears to encode a {PPTase}, as deduced from conserved residues considered important in {PPTases}. The {PPTase} candidate was used to search the {NCBI} data base and an unexpected homologue in A. nidulans was identified as {npgA}. Mutations in this gene ({cfwA}/ {npgA}) were identified previously as leading to defects in growth and pigmentation. To test whether the temperature-sensitive {cfwA}2 mutation impairs penicillin biosynthesis, which is dependent on the delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase, bioassays with B. calidolactis were set up at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. The {cfwA}2 mutant did not produce penicillin at the non-permissive temperature. Since no other {PPTase} homologue has been detected in the A. fumigatus genome to date, the data suggest that a single enzyme may be able to transfer the cofactor to a broad range of enzymes with acyl or peptidyl carrier protein domains.},

Cerulenin inhibited C18 fatty acid biosynthesis but had relatively little effect on radiolabel incorporation into C8 fatty acyl groups and n-heptane. [beta]-Mercaptoethanol inhibited n-heptane biosynthesis, with a corresponding accumulation of radiolabel into both octanal and 1-octanol, whereas hydroxylamine inhibited both n-heptane and 1-octanol biosynthesis, with radiolabel accumulation in octyl oximes. [14C]Octanal was converted to both n-heptane and 1-octanol when incubated with xylem sections, whereas [14C]1-octanol was converted to octanal and n-heptane in a hydroxylamine-sensitive reaction. These results suggest a pathway for the biosynthesis of n-heptane whereby acetate is polymerized via a typical fatty acid synthase reaction sequence to yield a C8 thioester, which subsequently undergoes a two-electron reduction to generate a free thiol and octanal, the latter of which alternately undergoes an additional, reversible reduction to form 1-octanol or loss of C1 to generate n-heptane.},

Eighteen fluxes of central metabolism were calculated from13C enrichments after near steady-state labeling by a metabolic model similar to that described in Dieuaide-Noubhani et al. (Dieuaide-Noubhani, M., Raffard, G., Canioni, P., Pradet, A., and Raymond, P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13147–13159), and 10 net fluxes were obtained directly from end-product accumulation rates. The absolute flux values of central metabolic pathways gradually slowed down with the decrease of glucose influx into the cells. However, the relative fluxes of glycolysis, the pentose-P pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle remained unchanged during the culture cycle at 70, 28, and 40\% of glucose influx, respectively, and the futile cycle of sucrose remained high at about 6-fold the glucose influx, independently from carbon nutritional conditions. This natural resistance to flux alterations is referred to as metabolic stability. The numerous anabolic pathways, including starch synthesis, hexose accumulation, biosynthesis of wall polysaccharides, and amino and organic acid biosynthesis were comparatively low and variable. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase flux decreased 5-fold in absolute terms and 2-fold in relation to the glucose influx rate during the culture cycle. We conclude that anabolic fluxes constitute the flexible part of plant cell metabolism that can fluctuate in relation to cell demands for growth.},

The absolute configurations of (R)-β-bisabolene, (R)-cuparene, (+)-β-barbatene, (-)-α-cedrene, (+)-β-cedrene, and (+)-α-funebrene originating from different key cationic intermediates, were determined by chiral {GC}-{MS} and proved to be related to the trichodiene stereostructure. The unusual compound (E)-iso-γ-bisabolene was also found corroborating a previously suggested mechanism for the cyclisation of the bisabolyl to the cuprenyl cation that is based on quantum mechanical calculations (Y. J. Hong, D. J. Tantillo, Org. Lett. 2006, 8, 4601-4604). These analyses resulted in a revised biosynthesis scheme to trichodiene and the side products of the responsible terpene cyclase, trichodiene synthase, an enzyme that is well characterised from Fusarium sporotrichioides. Feeding studies with several deuterated mevalonolactone isotopomers unravelled stereochemical aspects of the late cyclisations towards trichodiene.},

It has expanded to examine issues of global and local biodiversity, the problems associated with exotic species, and the debate concerning diversity and function. The third edition also focuses on current ecological discussions - diversity and function, scaling issues, disturbance, and invasive species - from a fungal perspective. In order to address these concepts, the book examines the appropriate techniques to identify fungi, calculate their abundance, determine their associations among themselves and other organisms, and measure their individual and community function. This book explains attempts to scale these measures from the microscopic cell level through local, landscape, and ecosystem levels. The totality of the ideas, methods, and results presented by the contributing authors points to the future direction of mycology.},

G., \& Kaback, H.R. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 12273]. Pyrene excimer fluorescence was detected for the double Cys mutants His322--{\textgreater}Cys/Glu325--{\textgreater}Cys, Arg302--{\textgreater}Cys/Glu325--{\textgreater}Cys, and Glu269--{\textgreater}Cys/His322--{\textgreater}Cys, indicating that helix X (His322--{\textgreater}Cys/Glu325--{\textgreater}Cys) is in an alpha-helical conformation and that helices {VIII} (Glu269--{\textgreater}Cys) and {IX} (Arg302--{\textgreater}Cys) are close to helix X (His322--{\textgreater}Cys and Glu325--{\textgreater}Cys). In this report, these interactions are used to study dynamic aspects of the permease. Excimer fluorescence between helices {VIII} and X or helices {IX} and X is markedly diminished by sodium dodecyl sulfate, while the excimer observed within helix X is unaffected, suggesting that tertiary interactions are disrupted by the denaturant with little effect on secondary structure. Furthermore, excimer fluorescence observed between helices {VIII} (Glu269--{\textgreater}Cys) and helix X (His322--{\textgreater}Cys) is quenched by Tl+, and the effect is markedly and specifically attenuated by ligands of the permease, suggesting that the pyrene becomes less accessible to the aqueous phase. The reactivity of single Cys residues at positions 269 or 322 was also examined by studying the rate of increase in fluorescence with N-(l-pyrenyl)maleimide. With both mutants, ligands of the permease cause a dramatic increase in reactivity which is consistent with the notion that these positions are transferred into a more hydrophobic environment.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

	doi = {10.1021/bi401643u},
	abstract = {The class I terpenoid cyclase epi-isozizaene synthase ({EIZS}) utilizes the universal achiral isoprenoid substrate, farnesyl diphosphate, to generate epi-isozizaene as the predominant sesquiterpene cyclization product and at least five minor sesquiterpene products, making {EIZS} an ideal platform for the exploration of fidelity and promiscuity in a terpenoid cyclization reaction. The hydrophobic active site contour of {EIZS} serves as a template that enforces a single substrate conformation, and chaperones subsequently formed carbocation intermediates through a well-defined mechanistic sequence. Here, we have used the crystal structure of {EIZS} as a guide to systematically remold the hydrophobic active site contour in a library of 26 site-specific mutants. Remolded cyclization templates reprogram the reaction cascade not only by reproportioning products generated by the wild-type enzyme but also by generating completely new products of diverse structure. Specifically, we have tripled the overall number of characterized products generated by {EIZS}. Moreover, we have converted {EIZS} into six different sesquiterpene synthases: F96A {EIZS} is an (E)-β-farnesene synthase, F96W {EIZS} is a zizaene synthase, F95H {EIZS} is a β-curcumene synthase, F95M {EIZS} is a β-acoradiene synthase, F198L {EIZS} is a β-cedrene synthase, and F96V {EIZS} and W203F {EIZS} are (Z)-γ-bisabolene synthases. Active site aromatic residues appear to be hot spots for reprogramming the cyclization cascade by manipulating the stability and conformation of critical carbocation intermediates. A majority of mutant enzymes exhibit only relatively modest 2-100-fold losses of catalytic activity, suggesting that residues responsible for triggering substrate ionization readily tolerate mutations deeper in the active site cavity.},

	abstract = {The development of tolerance in Pseudomonas putida {DOT}-T1 to toluene and related highly toxic compounds involves short- and long-term responses. The short-term response is based on an increase in the rigidity of the cell membrane by rapid transformation of the fatty acid cis-9,10-methylene hexadecanoic acid (C17:cyclopropane) to unsaturated 9-cis-hexadecenoic acid (C16:1,9 cis) and subsequent transformation to the trans isomer. The long-term response involves in addition to the changes in fatty acids, alterations in the level of the phospholipid polar head groups: cardiolipin increases and phosphatidylethanolamine decreases. The two alterations lead to increased cell membrane rigidity and should be regarded as physical mechanisms that prevent solvent penetrance. Biochemical mechanisms that decrease the concentration of toluene in the cell membrane also take place and involve: (i) a solvent exclusion system and (ii) metabolic removal of toluene via oxidation. Mutants unable to carry out cis [right-arrow] trans isomerization of unsaturated lipids, that exhibit altered cell envelopes because of the lack of the {OprL} protein, or that are unable to exclude toluene from cell membranes are hypersensitive to toluene.},

Mature colonies of T. viride cultured on Petri plates were placed in a growth chamber in a shared atmosphere with A. thaliana without direct physical contact. Compared to controls, plants grown in the presence of T. viride volatiles were taller, bigger, flowered earlier, and had more lateral roots.

	doi = {10.1002/bit.24536},
	abstract = {Monoterpenes are a diverse class of compounds with applications as flavors and fragrances, pharmaceuticals and more recently, jet fuels. Engineering biosynthetic pathways for monoterpene production in microbial hosts has received increasing attention. However, monoterpenes are highly toxic to many microorganisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a widely used industrial biocatalyst. In this work, the minimum inhibitory concentration ({MIC}) for S. cerevisiae was determined for five monoterpenes: β-pinene, limonene, myrcene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene (1.52, 0.44, 2.12, 0.70, 0.53 {mM}, respectively). Given the low {MIC} for all compounds tested, a liquid two-phase solvent extraction system to alleviate toxicity during fermentation was evaluated. Ten solvents were tested for biocompatibility, monoterpene distribution, phase separation, and price. The solvents dioctyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, and farnesene showed greater than 100-fold increase in the {MIC} compared to the monoterpenes in a solvent-free system. In particular, the {MIC} for limonene in dibutyl phthalate showed a 702-fold (308 {mM}, 42.1 g L(-1) of limonene) improvement while cell viability was maintained above 90\%, demonstrating that extractive fermentation is a suitable tool for the reduction of monoterpene toxicity. Finally, we estimated that a limonane to farnesane ratio of 1:9 has physicochemical properties similar to traditional Jet-A aviation fuel. Since farnesene is currently produced in S. cerevisiae, its use as a co-product and extractant for microbial terpene-based jet fuel production in a two-phase system offers an attractive bioprocessing option.},

Transformation of two Aspergilli (A. flavus and A. parasiticus) and a Fusarium (F. graminearum) with inverted repeat transgenes ({IRT}) containing sequences of mycotoxin-specific regulatory genes suppressed mycotoxin production in all three plant-pathogenic fungi. This atoxigenic phenotype was stable during infection on corn and wheat, and importantly, F. graminearum {IRT} strains were less virulent on wheat than were wild type.

	abstract = {The Périgord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) and the Piedmont white truffle dominate today’s truffle market. The hypogeous fruiting body of T. melanosporum is a gastronomic delicacy produced by an ectomycorrhizal symbiont endemic to calcareous soils in southern Europe. The worldwide demand for this truffle has fuelled intense efforts at cultivation. Identification of processes that condition and trigger fruit body and symbiosis formation, ultimately leading to efficient crop production, will be facilitated by a thorough analysis of truffle genomic traits. In the ectomycorrhizal Laccaria bicolor, the expansion of gene families may have acted as a ‘symbiosis toolbox’. This feature may however reflect evolution of this particular taxon and not a general trait shared by all ectomycorrhizal species. To get a better understanding of the biology and evolution of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, we report here the sequence of the haploid genome of T. melanosporum, which at {\textasciitilde}125 megabases is the largest and most complex fungal genome sequenced so far. This expansion results from a proliferation of transposable elements accounting for {\textasciitilde}58\% of the genome. In contrast, this genome only contains {\textasciitilde}7,500 protein-coding genes with very rare multigene families. It lacks large sets of carbohydrate cleaving enzymes, but a few of them involved in degradation of plant cell walls are induced in symbiotic tissues. The latter feature and the upregulation of genes encoding for lipases and multicopper oxidases suggest that T. melanosporum degrades its host cell walls during colonization. Symbiosis induces an increased expression of carbohydrate and amino acid transporters in both L. bicolor and T. melanosporum, but the comparison of genomic traits in the two ectomycorrhizal fungi showed that genetic predispositions for symbiosis—‘the symbiosis toolbox’—evolved along different ways in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.},

Extracting microbiome features that are relevant for a disease is challenging and existing variable selection methods are limited due to large number of risk factor variables from microbiome sequence data and their complex biological structure.
Results: We propose a tree-based scanning method, Selection of Models for the Analysis of Risk factor Trees (referred to as {SMART}-scan), for identifying taxonomic groups that are associated with a disease or trait. {SMART}-scan is a model selection technique that uses a predefined taxonomy to organize the large pool of possible predictors into optimized groups, and hierarchically searches and determines variable groups for association test. We investigate the statistical properties of {SMART}-scan through simulations, in comparison to a regular single-variable analysis and three commonly-used variable selection methods, stepwise regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LASSO}) and classification and regression tree ({CART}). When there are taxonomic group effects in the data, {SMART}-scan can significantly increase power by using bacterial taxonomic information to split large numbers of variables into groups. Through an application to microbiome data from a vervet monkey diet experiment, we demonstrate that {SMART}-scan can identify important phenotype-associated taxonomic features missed by single-variable analysis, stepwise regression, {LASSO} and {CART}.
Availability and implementation: The {SMART}-scan approach is implemented in R and is available at https://dsgweb.wustl.edu/qunyuan/software/smartscan/

No recurrences during the mean follow-up of 4.7 months were observed and the cosmetic effect was very good. In the study group with tissue adhesive the patients had significantly lower pain score after the first postoperative day and had a tendency to require less analgetic doses and to return earlier to their daily activity. Duration of the operation was similar in both groups. The cost of sutures and tissue adhesive used in both procedures was comparable.

	abstract = {Abstract  Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of fungal Argonaute, Dicer, and {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase-like proteins have been performed to gain insights into the diversification of {RNA} silencing pathways during the evolution of fungi. A wide range of fungi including ascomycetes, basidiomycetyes, and zygomycetes possesses multiple {RNA} silencing components in the genome, whereas a portion of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi apparently lacks the whole or most of the components. The number of paralogous silencing proteins in the genome differs considerably among fungal species, suggesting that {RNA} silencing pathways have diversified significantly during evolution in parallel with developing the complexity of life cycle or in response to environmental conditions. Interestingly, orthologous silencing proteins from different fungal clades are often clustered more closely than paralogous proteins in a fungus, indicating that duplication events occurred before speciation events. Therefore, the origin of multiple {RNA} silencing pathways seems to be very ancient, likely having occurred prior to the divergence of the major fungal lineages.},

	abstract = {Background: The polyene macrolide antibiotic nystatin produced by Streptomyces noursei {ATCC} 11455 is an important antifungal agent. The nystatin molecule contains a polyketide moiety represented by a 38-membered macrolactone ring to which the deoxysugar mycosamine is attached. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the nystatin biosynthesis is of considerable interest because this information can be used for the generation of new antifungal antibiotics.

Results: A {DNA} region of 123,580 base pairs from the S. noursei {ATCC} 11455 genome was isolated, sequenced and shown by gene disruption to be involved in nystatin biosynthesis. Analysis of the {DNA} sequence resulted in identification of six genes encoding a modular polyketide synthase ({PKS}), genes for thioesterase, deoxysugar biosynthesis, modification, transport and regulatory proteins. One of the {PKS}-encoding genes, {nysC}, was found to encode the largest (11,096 amino acids long) modular {PKS} described to date. Analysis of the deduced gene products allowed us to propose a model for the nystatin biosynthetic pathway in S. noursei.

Conclusions: A complete set of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the antifungal polyene antibiotic nystatin in S. noursei {ATCC} 11455 has been cloned and analyzed. This represents the first example of the complete {DNA} sequence analysis of a polyene antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster. Manipulation of the genes identified within the cluster may potentially lead to the generation of novel polyketides and yield improvements in the production strains.},

Mutants with Glu126--{\textgreater}Ala or Arg144--{\textgreater}Ala do not bind ligand or catalyze lactose accumulation, efflux, exchange, downhill lactose translocation, or lactose-induced H+ influx. In contrast, mutants with conservative mutations (Glu126--{\textgreater}Asp or Arg144--{\textgreater}Lys) exhibit drastically different phenotypes. Arg144--{\textgreater}Lys permease accumulates lactose slowly to low levels, but does not bind ligand or catalyze equilibrium exchange, efflux, or lactose-induced H+ influx. In contrast, Glu126--{\textgreater}Asp permease catalyzes lactose accumulation and lactose-induced H+ influx to wild-type levels, but at significantly lower rates. Surprisingly, however, no significant exchange or efflux activity is observed. Glu126--{\textgreater}Asp permease exhibits about a 6-fold increase in the Km for active transport relative to wild-type permease with a comparable Vmax. Direct binding assays using flow dialysis demonstrate that mutant Glu126--{\textgreater}Asp binds p-nitrophenyl-alpha,D-galactopyranoside. Indirect binding assays utilizing substrate protection against [14C]-N-ethylmaleimide labeling of single-Cys148 permease reveal an apparent Kd of 3-5 {mM} for lactose and 15-20 {microM} for beta, D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta,D-galactopyranoside ({TDG}). The affinity of Glu126--{\textgreater}Asp/Cys148 permease for lactose is markedly decreased (Kd {\textgreater} 80 {mM}), while {TDG} affinity is altered to a much lesser extent (Kd ca. 80 {microM}). The results extend the conclusion that a carboxylate at position 126 and a guanidinium group at position 144 are irreplaceable for substrate binding and support the idea that Arg144 plays a major role in substrate specificity.},

During a previous genome-wide transcriptional profiling screen, numerous novel gene clusters were found to be regulated by {LaeA} including a cluster required for the production of the antitumor agent terrequinone A. Beginnings and ends of secondary metabolite gene clusters are difficult to predict by gene sequence alone, but sharp demarcation of transcriptional control by {LaeA} suggested this protein might present a tool to identify cluster ends. To address this possibility in a first test case, we created null mutants of three genes, one regulated and two not regulated by {LaeA}, lying at the first, sixth and seventh position of a contiguous seven gene region where the third gene in this continuum was already shown to be required for terrequinone A production. Only the gene regulated by {LaeA}, {tdiE}, sixth in the series, was required for terrequinone A. In this pilot experiment, these findings experimentally validate {LaeA}-based predictions of the terrequinone biosynthetic locus boundaries. Further, this study identifies {TdiE} as a protein of unknown yet essential function for terrequinone A biosynthesis.},

Until recently, C. albicans was thought to be asexual, existing only as an obligate diploid. However, a mating locus was identified that was homologous to those in sexually reproducing fungi, and mating of C. albicans strains was subsequently demonstrated in the laboratory. In this review, we compare and contrast the mating process in C. albicans with that of other fungi, particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose mating has been most intensively studied. Several features of the mating pathway appear unique to C. albicans, including aspects of gene regulation and cell biology, as well as the involvement of “white-opaque” switching, an alteration between two quasi-stable inheritable states. These specializations of the mating process may have evolved to promote the survival of C. albicans in the hostile environment...},

	abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 {rbcL} sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms.

A promising pharmacological approach of antagonizing oncogenic Ras activity is to develop inhibitors of farnesyltransferase. We use Caenorhabditis elegans vulval differentiation, which is controlled by a Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway, as a model system to test previously identified farnesyltransferase inhibitors. We show here that two farnesyltransferase inhibitors, manumycin and gliotoxin, suppress the Multivulva phenotype resulting from an activated let-60 ras mutation, but not the Multivulva phenotype resulting from mutations in the lin-1 gene or the lin-15 gene, which act downstream and upstream of let-60 ras, respectively, in the signaling pathway. These results are consistent with the idea that the suppression of the Multivulva phenotype of let-60 ras by the two inhibitors is specific for Ras protein and that the mutant Ras protein might be more sensitive than wild-type Ras to the farnesyltransferase inhibitors. This work suggests that C. elegans vulval development could be a simple and effective in vivo system for evaluation of farnesyltransferase inhibitors against Ras-activated tumors.},

Pinene also inhibited the pumping of protons and K+ transport, but this inhibition was more marked with with ethanol than with glucose as the substrate, indicating the mitochondrial localization of the inhibition. The studies on isolated mitochondria showed a series of effects, starting with the disappearance of the respiratory control and deenergization of the organelles and followed by an inhibition of respiration at higher concentrations of the terpene. The effect on respiration could be localized to the cytochrome b region of the electron transport chain. No effect could be detected on the activity of {ATPase}. The effects can be ascribed to a localization of pinene on membranes which was also accompanied by a decrease in the fluorescence polarization of diphenyl hexatriene, probably meaning an increase in the fluidity of the membrane, localized preferentially to the mitochondria.},

	abstract = {The bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase ({WS}/{DGAT}) is the key enzyme in storage lipid accumulation in the gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter calcoaceticus {ADP}1, mediating wax ester, and to a lesser extent, triacylglycerol ({TAG}) biosynthesis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulates {TAGs} and steryl esters as storage lipids. Four genes encoding a {DGAT} (Dga1p), a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Lro1p) and two acyl-coenzyme A:sterol acyltransferases ({ASATs}) (Are1p and Are2p) are involved in the final esterification steps in {TAG} and steryl ester biosynthesis in this yeast. In the quadruple mutant strain S. cerevisiae H1246, the disruption of {DGA}1, {LRO}1, {ARE}1, and {ARE}2 leads to an inability to synthesize storage lipids. Heterologous expression of {WS}/{DGAT} from A. calcoaceticus {ADP}1 in S. cerevisiae H1246 restored {TAG} but not steryl ester biosynthesis, although high levels of {ASAT} activity could be demonstrated for {WS}/{DGAT} expressed in Escherichia coli {XL}1-Blue in radiometric in vitro assays with cholesterol and ergosterol as substrates. In addition to {TAG} synthesis, heterologous expression of {WS}/{DGAT} in S. cerevisiae H1246 resulted also in the accumulation of fatty acid ethyl esters as well as fatty acid isoamyl esters. In vitro studies confirmed that {WS}/{DGAT} is capable of utilizing a broad range of alcohols as substrates comprising long-chain fatty alcohols like hexadecanol as well as short-chain alcohols like ethanol or isoamyl alcohol. This study demonstrated the highly unspecific acyltransferase activity of {WS}/{DGAT} from A. calcoaceticus {ADP}1, indicating the broad biocatalytic potential of this enzyme for biotechnological production of a large variety of lipids in vivo in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic expression hosts.},

	issn = {0163-7827},
	abstract = {The cuticle covers the aerial portions of land plants. It consists of amorphous intracuticular wax embedded in cutin polymer, and epicuticular wax crystalloids that coat the outer plant surface and impart a whitish appearance. Cuticular wax is mainly composed of long-chain aliphatic compounds derived from very long chain fatty acids. Wax biosynthesis begins with fatty acid synthesis in the plastid. Here we focus on fatty acid elongation ({FAE}) to very long chains (C24-C34), and the subsequent processing of these elongated products into alkanes, secondary alcohols, ketones, primary alcohols and wax esters. The identity of the gene products involved in these processes is starting to emerge. Other areas of this field remain enigmatic. For example, it is not known how the hydrophobic wax components are moved intracellularly, how they are exported out of the cell, or translocated through the hydrophilic cell wall. Two hypotheses are presented for intracellular wax transport: direct transfer of lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, and Golgi mediated exocytosis. The potential roles of {ABC} transporters and non-specific lipid transfer proteins in wax export are also discussed. Biochemical-genetic and genomic approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana promise to be particularly useful in identifying and characterizing gene products involved in wax biosynthesis, secretion and function. The current review will, therefore, focus on Arabidopsis as a model for studying these processes.},

	abstract = {The spiroketal (E)-conophthorin has recently been reported as a semiochemical of the navel orangeworm moth, a major insect pest of California pistachios and almonds. Conophthorin and the isomeric spiroketal chalcogran are most commonly known as semiochemicals of several scolytid beetles. Conophthorin is both an insect- and plant-produced semiochemical widely recognized as a nonhost plant volatile from the bark of several angiosperm species. Chalcogran is the principal aggregation pheromone component of the six-spined spruce bark beetle. Recent research has shown conophthorin is produced by almonds undergoing hull-split, and both spiroketals are produced by mechanically damaged almonds. To better understand the origin of these spiroketals, the volatile emissions of orchard fungal spores on fatty acids common to both pistachios and almonds were evaluated. The volatile emission for the first 13 days of spores placed on a fatty acid was monitored. The spores investigated were Aspergillus flavus (atoxigenic), A. flavus (toxigenic), Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Penicillium glabrum, and Rhizopus stolonifer. The fatty acids used as growth media were palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic. Spores on linoleic acid produced both spiroketals, those on linolenic acid produced only chalcogran, and those on palmitic and oleic acid did not produce either spiroketal. This is the first report of the spiroketals conophthorin and chalcogran from a fungal source.},

	abstract = {Ethanol causes pancreatic damage by an unknown mechanism. Previously, we demonstrated that a sustained rise of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) causes pancreatic acinar cell injury. Here we have investigated the effects of ethanol and its metabolites on Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. Most cells exposed to ethanol (up to 850 {mM}) showed little or no increase in [Ca2+]i (and never at concentrations {\textless}50 {mM}). During sustained exposure to 850 {mM} ethanol, acetylcholine ({ACh}) evoked a normal [Ca2+]i elevation and following {ACh} removal there was a normal and rapid recovery to a low resting level. The oxidative metabolite acetaldehyde (up to 5 {mM}) had no effect, whereas the nonoxidative unsaturated metabolite palmitoleic acid ethyl ester (10–100 μM, added on top of 850 {mM} ethanol) induced sustained, concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i that were acutely dependent on external Ca2+ and caused cell death. These actions were shared by the unsaturated metabolite arachidonic acid ethyl ester, the saturated equivalents palmitic and arachidic acid ethyl esters, and the fatty acid palmitoleic acid. In the absence of external Ca2+, releasing all Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum by {ACh} (10 μM) or the specific Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin (2 μM) prevented such Ca2+ signal generation. We conclude that nonoxidative fatty acid metabolites, rather than ethanol itself, are responsible for the marked elevations of [Ca2+]i that mediate toxicity in the pancreatic acinar cell and that these compounds act primarily by releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum.},

	abstract = {Eumycetoma is a chronic fungal infection characterised by large subcutaneous masses and the presence of sinuses discharging coloured grains. The causative agents of black-grain eumycetoma mostly belong to the orders Sordariales and Pleosporales. The aim of the present study was to clarify the phylogeny and taxonomy of pleosporalean agents, viz. Madurella grisea, Medicopsis romeroi (syn.: Pyrenochaeta romeroi), Nigrograna mackinnonii (syn. Pyrenochaeta mackinnonii), Leptosphaeria senegalensis, L. tompkinsii, and Pseudochaetosphaeronema larense. A phylogenetic analysis based on five loci was performed: the Internal Transcribed Spacer ({ITS}), large ({LSU}) and small ({SSU}) subunit ribosomal {RNA}, the second largest {RNA} polymerase subunit ({RPB}2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha ({TEF}1) gene. In addition, the morphological and physiological characteristics were determined. Three species were well-resolved at the family and genus level. Madurella grisea, L. senegalensis, and L. tompkinsii were found to belong to the family Trematospheriaceae and are reclassified as Trematosphaeria grisea comb. nov., Falciformispora senegalensis comb. nov., and F. tompkinsii comb. nov. Medicopsis romeroi and Pseudochaetosphaeronema larense were phylogenetically distant and both names are accepted. The genus Nigrograna is reduced to synonymy of Biatriospora and therefore N. mackinnonii is reclassified as B. mackinnonii comb. nov. Mycetoma agents in Pleosporales were phylogenetically quite diverse despite their morphological similarity in the formation of pycnidia, except for the ascosporulating genus Falciformispora (formerly in Leptosphaeria). Most of the species diagnosed from human mycetoma were found to be related to waterborne or marine fungi, suggesting an association of the virulence factors with oligotrophism or halotolerance.},

Concentrations of amorphadiene, the sesquiterpene olefin precursor to artemisinin, reached 24 g caryophyllene equivalent/ml.

However, almost nothing is known about enediyne core biosynthesis, and the determinants of 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence remain elusive. Previous work identified enediyne-specific polyketide synthases ({PKSEs}) that can be phylogenetically distinguished as being involved in 9- versus 10-membered enediyne biosynthesis, suggesting that biosynthetic divergence might originate from differing {PKSE} chemistries. Recent in vitro studies have identified several compounds produced by the {PKSE} and associated thioesterase ({TE}), but condition-dependent product profiles make it difficult to ascertain a true catalytic difference between 9- and 10-membered {PKSE}-{TE} systems. Here we report that {PKSE} chemistry does not direct 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence as revealed by comparing the products from three 9-membered and two 10-membered {PKSE}-{TE} systems under identical conditions using robust in vivo assays. Three independent experiments support a common catalytic function for 9- and 10-membered {PKSEs} by the production of a heptaene metabolite from: (i) all five cognate {PKSE}-{TE} pairs in Escherichia coli; (ii) the C-1027 and calicheamicin cognate {PKSE}-{TEs} in Streptomyces lividans K4-114; and (iii) selected native producers of both 9- and 10-membered enediynes. Furthermore, {PKSEs} and {TEs} from different 9- and 10-membered enediyne biosynthetic machineries are freely interchangeable, revealing that 9- versus 10-membered enediyne core biosynthetic divergence occurs beyond the {PKSE}-{TE} level. These findings establish a starting point for determining the origins of this biosynthetic divergence.},

Species of Massarina used in the study clustered into two distinct clades with high bootstrap support in trees generated from maximum parsimony, weighted parsimony, maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining analyses. The hypothesis that Massarina species belong to a phylogenetically monophyletic group is rejected. Species with narrowly fusiform ascospores form a monophyletic clade with Lophiostoma, a genus highly similar in morphology. The five species currently accepted in Massarina with such spore morphology are here transferred into the genus Lophiostoma. Massarina species with broadly fusiform to ellipsoidal ascospores are retained as Massarina s. str., lectotypified by M. eburnea. Massarina walkeri is presently excluded from both Massarina and Lophiostoma. The transfer of M. papulosa to a new genus Oletheriostrigula is verified.},

Lignin generally presents a barrier to biomass utilization; this problem may be circumvented by the genetic alteration of lignin-producing plants. Plant cellulosic material will need to be utilized more efficiently, requiring a greater knowledge of the multiprotein complex, the cellulosome. Many biofuel types are being considered: alcohols, esters, ethers, and hydrocarbons. Intrinsic alcohol toxicity to cells may impose limitations on ethanol and n-butanol production. Biodiesel, or fatty acid esters, can now be synthesized via recombinant Escherichia coli and may offer an improvement over alcohol fermentations.

	doi = {10.2337/db07-1403},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}—Diabetes and obesity are characterized by a low-grade inflammation whose molecular origin is unknown. We previously determined, first, that metabolic endotoxemia controls the inflammatory tone, body weight gain, and diabetes, and second, that high-fat feeding modulates gut microbiota and the plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}), i.e., metabolic endotoxemia. Therefore, it remained to demonstrate whether changes in gut microbiota control the occurrence of metabolic diseases.
{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}—We changed gut microbiota by means of antibiotic treatment to demonstrate, first, that changes in gut microbiota could be responsible for the control of metabolic endotoxemia, the low-grade inflammation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes and, second, to provide some mechanisms responsible for such effect.
{RESULTS}—We found that changes of gut microbiota induced by an antibiotic treatment reduced metabolic endotoxemia and the cecal content of {LPS} in both high-fat–fed and ob/ob mice. This effect was correlated with reduced glucose intolerance, body weight gain, fat mass development, lower inflammation, oxidative stress, and macrophage infiltration marker {mRNA} expression in visceral adipose tissue. Importantly, high-fat feeding strongly increased intestinal permeability and reduced the expression of genes coding for proteins of the tight junctions. Furthermore, the absence of {CD}14 in ob/ob {CD}14−/− mutant mice mimicked the metabolic and inflammatory effects of antibiotics.
{CONCLUSIONS}—This new finding demonstrates that changes in gut microbiota controls metabolic endotoxemia, inflammation, and associated disorders by a mechanism that could increase intestinal permeability. It would thus be useful to develop strategies for changing gut microbiota to control, intestinal permeability, metabolic endotoxemia, and associated disorders.},

Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies allow for even finer resolution. We compared phylogenetic profiling of both longer (454 Titanium) sequence reads with shorter, but more numerous, paired-end reads (Illumina). For both approaches, we targeted six tandem combinations of 16S {rRNA} gene variable regions, in microbial {DNA} extracted from a human faecal sample, in order to investigate their limitations and potentials. In silico evaluations predicted that the V3/V4 and V4/V5 regions would provide the highest classification accuracies for both technologies. However, experimental sequencing of the V3/V4 region revealed significant amplification bias compared to the other regions, emphasising the necessity for experimental validation of primer pairs. The latest developments of 454 and Illumina technologies offered higher resolution compared to their previous versions, and showed relative consistency with each other. However, the majority of the Illumina reads could not be classified down to genus level due to their shorter length and higher error rates beyond 60 nt. Nonetheless, with improved quality and longer reads, the far greater coverage of Illumina promises unparalleled insights into highly diverse and complex environments such as the human gut.},

Two [alpha]-tubulin genes of C. lagenarium were isolated, and {GFP}-[alpha]-tubulin protein was expressed in this fungus. The strain expressing the fusion protein formed fluorescent filaments that were disrupted by a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, benomyl, demonstrating successful visualization of microtubules. In preincubated conidia, {GFP}-labeled interphase microtubules, showing random orientation, were observed. At conidial germination, microtubules oriented toward a germination site. At nuclear division, when germ tubes had formed appressoria, mitotic spindles appeared inside conidia followed by disassembly of interphase microtubules. Remarkably, time-lapse views showed that interphase microtubules contact a microtubule-associated center at the cell cortex of conidia that is different from a nuclear spindle pole body ({SPB}) before their disassembly. Duplicated nuclear {SPBs} separately moved toward conidium and appressorium accompanied by astral microtubule formation. Benomyl treatment caused movement of both daughter nuclei into 70\% of appressoria and affected appressorium morphogenesis. In conidia elongating hyphae without appressoria, microtubules showed polar elongation which is distinct from their random orientation inside appressoria.},

Using barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing at 13 sites (10 trees/site; 10 leaves/tree), we found very high levels of diversity within sites (a mean of 551 ± 134 taxonomic units per site). However, among-site diversity contributed even more than did within-site diversity to the overall richness of more than 4,200 taxonomic units observed in M. polymorpha, and this among-site variation in endophyte community composition correlated strongly with temperature and rainfall. These results are consistent with suggestions that foliar endophytic fungi are hyperdiverse. They further suggest that microbial diversity may be even greater than has been assumed and that broad-scale environmental controls such as temperature and rainfall can structure eukaryotic microbial diversity. Appropriately constrained study systems across strong environmental gradients present a useful means to understand the environmental factors that structure the diversity of microbial communities.},

We describe here a novel gene with sequence similarity to plant expansins, isolated from the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei. The protein named swollenin has an N-terminal fungal type cellulose binding domain connected by a linker region to the expansin-like domain. The protein also contains regions similar to mammalian fibronectin type {III} repeats, found for the first time in a fungal protein. The swollenin gene is regulated in a largely similar manner as the T. reesei cellulase genes. The biological role of {SWOI} was studied by disrupting the swo1 gene from T. reesei. The disruption had no apparent effect on the growth rate on glucose or on different cellulosic carbon sources. Non-stringent Southern hybridization of Trichoderma genomic {DNA} with swo1 showed the presence of other swollenin-like genes, which could substitute for the loss of {SWOI} in the disruptant. The swollenin gene was expressed in yeast and Aspergillus niger var. awamori. Activity assays on cotton fibers and filter paper were performed with concentrated {SWOI}-containing yeast supernatant that disrupted the structure of the cotton fibers without detectable formation of reducing sugars. It also weakened filter paper as assayed by an extensometer. The {SWOI} protein was purified from A. niger var. awamori culture supernatant and used in an activity assay with Valonia cell walls. It disrupted the structure of the cell walls without producing detectable amounts of reducing sugars.},

To identify the molecular mechanisms of manumycin A action, cultured human {HepG}2 hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with various {IKKalpha} and {IKKbeta} constructs, and a striking difference in manumycin A sensitivity was observed. Furthermore, cells expressing wild-type {IKKbeta} and {IKKbeta} mutated in the activation loop at Cys-179 exhibited covalent homotypic dimerization of {IKKbeta} in response to manumycin A, whereas substitution of Cys-662 and -716 conferred protection against dimer formation. Direct inhibition of {IKK} activity and formation of stable {IKKbeta} dimers were observed in the presence of manumycin A that could be blocked by dithiothreitol. {IKK} interaction with the adaptor protein {IKKgamma}/{NEMO} was disrupted in manumycin A-treated cells. Most importantly, administration of manumycin A to mice xenografted with murine B16F10 tumors caused potent {IKK}-suppressive effects. Thus, manumycin A with its epoxyquinoid moieties plays an important regulatory function in {IKK} signaling through pathways distinct from its role as a protein farnesylation inhibitor.},

During the past 15 years, pharmaceutical industry research into natural products has declined, in part because of an emphasis on high-throughput screening of synthetic libraries. Currently there is substantial decline in new drug approvals and impending loss of patent protection for important medicines. However, untapped biological resources, “smart screening” methods, robotic separation with structural analysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology offer exciting technologies for new natural product drug discovery. Advances in rapid genetic sequencing, coupled with manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, may provide a vast resource for the future discovery of pharmaceutical agents.},

The suborder Pleosporineae is emended to include four families, viz. Didymellaceae, Leptosphaeriaceae, Phaeosphaeriaceae and Pleosporaceae. In addition, two new families are introduced, i.e. Amniculicolaceae and Lentitheciaceae. Pleomassariaceae is treated as a synonym of Melanommataceae, and new circumscriptions of Lophiostomataceae s. str., Massarinaceae and Lophiotrema are proposed. Familial positions of Entodesmium and Setomelanomma in Phaeosphaeriaceae, Neophaeosphaeria in Leptosphaeriaceae, Leptosphaerulina, Macroventuria and Platychora in Didymellaceae, Pleomassaria in Melanommataceae and Bimuria, Didymocrea, Karstenula and Paraphaeosphaeria in Montagnulaceae are clarified. Both ecological and morphological characters show varying degrees of phylogenetic significance. Pleosporales is most likely derived from a saprobic ancestor with fissitunicate asci containing conspicuous ocular chambers and apical rings.

The algorithm does not require a pre-determined training set to estimate parameters of the underlying hidden Markov model ({HMM}). Instead, the anonymous genomic sequence in question is used as an input for iterative unsupervised training. The algorithm extends our previously developed method tested on genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. To better reflect features of fungal gene organization, we enhanced the intron submodel to accommodate sequences with and without branch point sites. This design enables the algorithm to work equally well for species with the kinds of variations in splicing mechanisms seen in the fungal phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota. Upon self-training the intron submodel switches on in several steps to reach its full complexity. We demonstrate that the algorithm accuracy, both at the exon and the whole gene level, is favorably compared to the accuracy of gene finders that employ supervised training. Application of the new method to known fungal genomes indicates substantial improvement over existing annotations. By eliminating the effort necessary to build comprehensive training sets, the new algorithm can streamline and accelerate the process of annotation in a large number of fungal genome sequencing projects.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that Arabidopsis is largely self-pollinating, its flowers emit a complex mixture of terpene volatiles consisting predominantly of a large group of over 20 sesquiterpenes. Here we report that only two terpene synthases, encoded by the florally expressed genes At5g23960 and At5g44630, are responsible for the formation of virtually all sesquiterpenes found in the Arabidopsis floral volatile blend. Two independent mutant lines with T-{DNA} insertions in the previously identified At5g23960 gene lacked the emission of three sesquiterpenes, including the main sesquiterpene volatile (E)-beta-caryophyllene, confirming the previous in vitro functional assignment for this gene. Flowers of a mutant line carrying a T-{DNA} insertion in gene At5g44630 emitted these three sesquiterpenes, but did not emit any of the remaining sesquiterpene volatiles. An At5g44630 {cDNA} was expressed in Escherichia coli and the produced protein catalyzed the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate into over 15 sesquiterpenes in similar proportions to those found in the floral volatile blend. At5g23960 and At5g44630 promoter-beta-glucuronidase ({GUS}) fusion experiments demonstrated that both genes are expressed in several parts of the Arabidopsis flower, with strong At5g23960 promoter-{GUS} activity in the stigma and strong expression of At5g44630 in intrafloral nectaries. Given the previously reported antimicrobial activity of terpenes, their production in stigmas and nectaries may serve to inhibit microbial infection at these vulnerable sites. A survey of 37 Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes revealed quantitative, but almost no qualitative, variations of floral monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions suggesting that floral terpene volatiles must play some significant role in the life of the Arabidopsis plant.},

Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, ≥ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S {rDNA} amplicons with 16S {rDNA} fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes.

The products of polysaccharide fermentation include short-chain fatty acids that are ligands for Gpr41, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed by a subset of enteroendocrine cells in the gut epithelium. To examine the contribution of Gpr41 to energy balance, we compared Gpr41-/- and Gpr41+/+ mice that were either conventionally-raised with a complete gut microbiota or were reared germ-free and then cocolonized as young adults with two prominent members of the human distal gut microbial community: the saccharolytic bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the methanogenic archaeon, Methanobrevibacter smithii. Both conventionally-raised and gnotobiotic Gpr41-/- mice colonized with the model fermentative community are significantly leaner and weigh less than their {WT} (+/+) littermates, despite similar levels of chow consumption. These differences are not evident when germ-free {WT} and germ-free Gpr41 knockout animals are compared. Functional genomic, biochemical, and physiologic studies of germ-free and cocolonized Gpr41-/- and +/+ littermates disclosed that Gpr41-deficiency is associated with reduced expression of {PYY}, an enteroendocrine cell-derived hormone that normally inhibits gut motility, increased intestinal transit rate, and reduced harvest of energy (short-chain fatty acids) from the diet. These results reveal that Gpr41 is a regulator of host energy balance through effects that are dependent upon the gut microbiota.},

However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering ({MAGE}) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. {MAGE} simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the {MAGE} technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied {MAGE} to optimize the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate ({DXP}) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the {DXP} pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic {DNA}, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

Objectives: We analyzed sputum gene expression for transcriptomic endotypes of asthma ({TEA}); gene signatures that discriminate phenotypes of disease.  Methods: Gene expression in sputum and blood of asthma patients was measured using Affymetrix gene expression microarrays. Unsupervised clustering analysis based on pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was used to identify {TEA} clusters. Logistic regression analysis of matched blood samples defined an expression profile in the circulation to determine the {TEA} cluster assignment in a cohort of children with asthma for validation.   Measurements and Main Results: Three {TEA} clusters were identified. {TEA} cluster 1 had the most subjects with a history of intubation (P = 0.05), a lower pre-bronchodilator {FEV}1 (P = 0.006), a higher bronchodilator response (P = 0.03), and higher exhaled nitric oxide levels (P = 0.04), compared to the other {TEA} clusters. {TEA} cluster 2, the smallest cluster had the most subjects that were hospitalized for asthma (P = 0.04). {TEA} cluster 3, the largest cluster, had normal lung function, low exhaled nitric oxide levels, and lower inhaled steroid requirements. Evaluation of {TEA} clusters in children confirmed that {TEA} clusters 1 and 2 are associated with a history of intubation (P = 5.58 x 10-06) and hospitalization (P = 0.01), respectively.  Conclusions: There are common patterns of gene expression in the sputum and blood of children and adults that are associated with near fatal, severe and milder asthma.},

We describe this property of correlated evolution by characterizing each protein by its phylogenetic profile, a string that encodes the presence or absence of a protein in every known genome. We show that proteins having matching or similar profiles strongly tend to be functionally linked. This method of phylogenetic profiling allows us to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins.},

	abstract = {Global energy and environmental problems have stimulated increased efforts towards synthesizing biofuels from renewable resources. Compared to the traditional biofuel, ethanol, higher alcohols offer advantages as gasoline substitutes because of their higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity. In addition, branched-chain alcohols have higher octane numbers compared with their straight-chain counterparts. However, these alcohols cannot be synthesized economically using native organisms. Here we present a metabolic engineering approach using Escherichia coli to produce higher alcohols including isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol from glucose, a renewable carbon source. This strategy uses the host's highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway and diverts its 2-keto acid intermediates for alcohol synthesis. In particular, we have achieved high-yield, high-specificity production of isobutanol from glucose. The strategy enables the exploration of biofuels beyond those naturally accumulated to high quantities in microbial fermentation.},

The relationship between the increase in membrane fluidity induced by these compounds and their inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation was observed. Experiments with the four probes showed that n-hexyl alcohol induced decreases in the order parameter of 5-{NS} and apparent rotational correlation times of the other probes at the same minimal alcohol concentration. The decreases were observed in the concentration range that inhibited aggregation. n-Amyl alcohol and n-butyl alcohol decreased the values of the parameters of the above mentioned only at higher concentrations that were dependent on their hydrophobicities. Like alkyl alcohols, benzyl alcohol and phenolic compounds decreased the values of the parameters in the concentration ranges in which these compounds inhibited platelet aggregation. The concentration of these compounds causing 50\% inhibition of platelet aggregation, the {IC}50 values, and data on 5-{NS}-labeled platelets indicated that they inhibited aggregation and decreased the value of the order parameter at lower concentrations relative to their Poct values in comparison to the effective concentrations of alcohols. Phenolic compounds also decreased the values of the apparent rotational correlation times of 5-{NMS} and 16-{NMS}. These results indicate that the inhibition of platelet aggregation by alcohols and phenolic compounds is due to membrane perturbation in wide range in depths within the lipid bilayer.

	abstract = {Terminal olefins (1-alkenes) are natural products that have important industrial applications as both fuels and chemicals. However, their biosynthesis has been largely unexplored. We describe a group of bacteria, Jeotgalicoccus spp., which synthesize terminal olefins, in particular 18-methyl-1-nonadecene and 17-methyl-1-nonadecene. These olefins are derived from intermediates of fatty acid biosynthesis, and the key enzyme in Jeotgalicoccus sp. {ATCC} 8456 is a terminal olefin-forming fatty acid decarboxylase. This enzyme, Jeotgalicoccus sp. {OleT} ({OleTJE}), was identified by purification from cell lysates, and its encoding gene was identified from a draft genome sequence of Jeotgalicoccus sp. {ATCC} 8456 using reverse genetics. Heterologous expression of the identified gene conferred olefin biosynthesis to Escherichia coli. {OleTJE} is a P450 from the cyp152 family, which includes bacterial fatty acid hydroxylases. Some cyp152 P450 enzymes have the ability to decarboxylate and to hydroxylate fatty acids (in \{alpha\}- and/or \{beta\}-position), suggesting a common reaction intermediate in their catalytic mechanism and specific structural determinants that favor one reaction over the other. The discovery of these terminal olefin-forming P450 enzymes represents a third biosynthetic pathway (in addition to alkane and long-chain olefin biosynthesis) to convert fatty acid intermediates into hydrocarbons. Olefin-forming fatty acid decarboxylation is a novel reaction that can now be added to the catalytic repertoire of the versatile cytochrome P450 enzyme family.},

Despite ongoing declines and sensitivity to environmental change, amphibian distributions are particularly poorly understood. We present a global analysis of contemporary environmental and historical constraints on amphibian richness, the first for an ectotherm clade at this scale. Amphibians are presumed to experience environmental constraints distinct from those of better studied endothermic taxa due to their stringent water requirements and the temperature dependence of their energetic costs and performance. Single environmental predictors set upper bounds on, but do not exclusively determine, amphibian richness. Accounting for differing regional histories of speciation and extinction helps resolve triangular or scattered relationships between core environmental predictors and amphibian richness, as the relationships' intercepts or slopes can vary regionally. While the magnitude of richness is strongly determined by regional history, within-region patterns are consistently jointly driven by water and temperature. This confirms that ecophysiological constraints extend to the broad scale. This coupling suggests that shifts in climatic regimes will probably have dramatic consequences for amphibians. Our results illustrate how the environmental and historical explanations of species richness gradients can be reconciled and how the perspectives are complements for understanding broad-scale patterns of diversity.},

Moreover, butanol has been considered as a potential fuel or fuel additive. Biological production of butanol (with acetone and ethanol) was one of the largest industrial fermentation processes early in the 20th century. However, fermentative production of butanol had lost its competitiveness by 1960s due to increasing substrate costs and the advent of more efficient petrochemical processes. Recently, increasing demand for the use of renewable resources as feedstock for the production of chemicals combined with advances in biotechnology through omics, systems biology, metabolic engineering and innovative process developments is generating a renewed interest in fermentative butanol production. This article reviews biotechnological production of butanol by clostridia and some relevant fermentation and downstream processes.

	abstract = {Asexual spores (conidia) of Aspergillus nidulans contain a dark green pigment which is not present in other cell types. Synthesis of this pigment is catalyzed, in part, by a developmentally controlled p-diphenol oxidase, or laccase, encoded at the gamma A genetic locus (A. J. Clutterbuck, J. Gen. Microbiol. 70:423-435, 1972). We have investigated the mechanisms regulating expression of the gamma A gene of A. nidulans. Vegetative hyphae grown in submerged culture lacked detectable laccase enzyme activity and neither contained nor synthesized immunoprecipitable laccase protein. When such cultures were induced to conidiate by harvesting the cells onto filter papers and aerating them, laccase levels began to increase after 10 to 16 h, reached a peak at 20 to 36 h, and then declined slowly. Immunological assays showed that increases in laccase enzyme activity were (i) proceded by a transient rise in the relative rate of laccase protein synthesis and (ii) closely paralleled by increases in the amount of laccase protein. Addition of cycloheximide to cultures at any time after inducing conidiation inhibited further accumulation of laccase enzyme activity. These data are most consistent with increases in laccase levels being due to regulated, de novo synthesis of laccase protein. Addition of inhibitors of ribonucleic acid synthesis to conidiating cultures also inhibited further accumulation of laccase, suggesting that laccase expression is regulated by alterations in the transcriptional activity of the gamma A locus.},

	volume = {864},
	issn = {0006-3002},
	abstract = {In the 1970's great strides were made in understanding the mechanism of action of amphotericin B and nystatin: the formation of transmembrane pores was clearly demonstrated in planar lipid monolayers, in multilamellar phospholipid vesicles and in Acholeplasma laidlawii cells and the importance of the presence and of the nature of the membrane sterol was analyzed. For polyene antibiotics with shorter chains, a mechanism of membrane disruption was proposed. However, recently obtained data on unilamellar vesicles have complicated the situation. It has been shown that: membranes in the gel state (which is not common in cells), even if they do not contain sterols may be made permeable by polyene antibiotics, several mechanisms may operate, simultaneously or sequentially, depending on the antibiotic/lipid ratio, the time elapsed after mixing and the mode of addition of the antibiotic, there is a rapid exchange of the antibiotic molecules between the vesicles. Although pore formation is apparently involved in the toxicity of amphotericin B and nystatin, it is not the sole factor which contributes to cell death, since K+ leakage induced by these antibiotics is separate from their lethal action. The peroxidation of membrane lipids, which has been demonstrated for erythrocytes and Candida albicans cells in the presence of amphotericin B, may play a determining role in toxicity concurrently with colloid osmotic effect. On the other hand, it has been shown that the action of polyene antibiotics on cells is not always detrimental: at sub-lethal concentrations these drugs stimulate either the activity of some membrane enzymes or cellular metabolism. In particular, some cells of the immune system are stimulated. Furthermore, polyene antibiotics may act synergistically with other drugs, such as antitumor or antifungal compounds. This may occur either by an increased incorporation of the drug, under the influence of a polyene antibiotic-induced change of membrane potential, for example, or by a direct interaction of both drugs. That fungal membranes contain ergosterol while mammalian cell membranes contain cholesterol, has generally been considered the basis for the selective toxicity of amphotericin B and nystatin for fungi. Actually, in vitro studies have not always borne out this assumption, thereby casting doubt on the use of polyene antibiotics as antifungal agents in mammalian cell culture media.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Gene amplification and sequencing have led to the discovery of new pathogens as agents of disease and have enabled us to better classify microorganisms from culture. Sequence-based identification of bacteria and fungi using culture is more objective and accurate than conventional methods, especially for classifying unusual microorganisms that are emerging pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. Although a powerful tool, the interpretation of sequence-based classification can be challenging as microbial taxonomy grows more complex, without known clinical correlatives. Additionally, broad-range gene polymerase chain reaction and sequencing have emerged as alternative, culture-independent methods for detecting pathogens from clinical material. The promise of this technique has remained strong, limited mainly by contamination and inadequate sensitivity issues. This review explains sequence-based microbial classification, with emphasis on relating the complex world of microbial taxonomy to a clinical context. Additionally, this review discusses a rational approach to broad-range bacterial polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing when applied directly to clinical samples.},

Starting with introducing an acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterase gene, we made six successive generations of genetic modifications of cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. {PCC}6803 wild type ({SD}100). The fatty acid secretion yield was increased to 197 ± 14 mg/L of culture in one improved strain at a cell density of 1.0 × 109 cells/{mL} by adding codon-optimized thioesterase genes and weakening polar cell wall layers. Although these strains exhibited damaged cell membranes at low cell densities, they grew more rapidly at high cell densities in late exponential and stationary phase and exhibited less cell damage than cells in wild-type cultures. Our results suggest that fatty acid secreting cyanobacteria are a promising technology for renewable biofuel production.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:At present, there is not a widely accepted consensus view regarding the phylogenetic structure of kingdom Fungi although two major phyla, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, are clearly delineated. Regarding the lower fungi, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota, a variety of proposals have been advanced. Microsporidia may or may not be fungi; the Glomales (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) may or may not constitute a fifth fungal phylum, and the loss of the flagellum may have occurred either once or multiple times during fungal evolution. All of these issues are capable of being resolved by a molecular phylogenetic analysis which achieves strong statistical support for major branches. To date, no fungal phylogeny based upon molecular characters has satisfied this criterion.{RESULTS}:Using the translated amino acid sequences of the {RPB}1 and {RPB}2 genes, we have inferred a fungal phylogeny that consists largely of well-supported monophyletic phyla. Our major results, each with significant statistical support, are: (1) Microsporidia are sister to kingdom Fungi and are not members of Zygomycota; that is, Microsporidia and fungi originated from a common ancestor. (2) Chytridiomycota, the only fungal phylum having a developmental stage with a flagellum, is paraphyletic and is the basal lineage. (3) Zygomycota is monophyletic based upon sampling of Trichomycetes, Zygomycetes, and Glomales. (4) Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota form a monophyletic group separate from Chytridiomycota. (5) Basidiomycota and Ascomycota are monophyletic sister groups.{CONCLUSION}:In general, this paper highlights the evolutionary position and significance of the lower fungi (Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota). Our results suggest that loss of the flagellum happened only once during early stages of fungal evolution; consequently, the majority of fungi, unlike plants and animals, are nonflagellated. The phylogeny we infer from gene sequences is the first one that is congruent with the widely accepted morphology-based classification of Fungi. We find that, contrary to what has been published elsewhere, the four morphologically defined phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota) do not overlap with one another. Microsporidia are not included within kingdom Fungi; rather they are a sister-group to the Fungi. Our study demonstrates the applicability of protein sequences from large, slowly-evolving genes to the derivation of well-resolved and highly supported phylogenies across long evolutionary distances.},

For example, miscibility behavior varies with lipid type, lipid ratio, lipid oxidation, and level of impurity. Liquid domains are often circular, but can become noncircular when membranes are near critical points.

A potential tool is Agrobacterium-mediated fungal transformation. A. tumefaciens is able to transfer a part of its {DNA} (transferred {DNA}; T-{DNA}) to a wide variety of fungi and the number of fungi that can be transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation ({AMT}) is still increasing. {AMT} has especially opened the field of molecular genetics for fungi that were difficult to transform with traditional methods or for which the traditional protocols failed to yield stable {DNA} integration. Because of the simplicity and efficiency of transformation via A. tumefaciens, it is relatively easy to generate a large number of stable transformants. In combination with the finding that the T-{DNA} integrates randomly and predominantly as a single copy, {AMT} is well suited to perform insertional mutagenesis in fungi. In addition, in various gene-targeting experiments, high homologous recombination frequencies were obtained, indicating that the T-{DNA} is also a useful substrate for targeted mutagenesis. In this review, we discuss the potential of the Agrobacterium {DNA} transfer system to be used as a tool for targeted and random mutagenesis in fungi.},

Despite these variations, eight {VOCs} markers could be identified allowing the discrimination of the three species.

On one side, seven of them were also detected in the fruiting body, confirming their mycelial origin. On the other side, the total absence of some class of compounds (i.e. sulfur) in the mycelium raises questions about their origins in the fruiting bodies and confirms deep metabolic changes between the reproductive (fruiting body) and vegetative (mycelium) stages.},

The pharmacokinetic profile of delta 4-{VPA} was similar to that of {VPA} in the monkey, although the unbound fraction of delta 4-{VPA} in plasma was approximately 2.5-fold greater than the value for the parent drug. The major route of elimination of delta 4-{VPA} was excretion into urine, and studies with a group of eight animals indicated that delta 4-{VPA} undergoes extensive biotransformation in this species. A total of 20 metabolites was detected in urine by {GC}-{MS} techniques, and 19 of these were identified positively by comparison of their gas-liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric properties with those of the authentic compounds prepared by synthesis. Many of these metabolites were present largely in the form of glucuronide conjugates, as was delta 4-{VPA} itself. The major pathways of metabolism of delta 4-{VPA} were found to be ester glucuronide formation and beta-oxidation, whereas omega- and (omega-1)-oxidation processes were of minor quantitative importance. Excretion of unchanged drug and its metabolites into urine over 24 hr accounted collectively for some 59\% of the administered dose, a figure which was appreciably less than the corresponding recovery of metabolites of {VPA} in the same monkeys. The possibility is raised that beta-oxidation of delta 4-{VPA} leads to the generation of a chemically reactive intermediate(s) which alkylate(s) cellular macromolecules and thereby forms tissue-bound residues. The significance of such a phenomenon is discussed in relation to the etiology of {VPA}-induced liver injury.},

Therefore, definition of the virome is an important step toward understanding how microbes affect human health and disease. We review progress in virome analysis, which has been driven by advances in high-throughput, deep sequencing technology. Highlights from these studies include the association of viruses with clinical phenotypes and description of novel viruses that may be important pathogens. Together these studies indicate that analysis of the human virome is critical as we aim to understand how microbial communities influence human health and disease. Descriptions of the human virome will stimulate future work to understand how the virome affects long-term human health, immunity, and response to coinfections.

We have previously demonstrated production of higher alcohols from Escherichia coli using a 2-keto acid-based pathway. Here, we took advantage of the growth phenotype associated with 2-keto acid deficiency to construct a hyperproducer of 1-propanol and 1-butanol by evolving citramalate synthase ({CimA}) from Methanococcus jannaschii. This new pathway, which directly converts pyruvate to 2-ketobutyrate, bypasses threonine biosynthesis and represents the shortest keto acid-mediated pathway for producing 1-propanol and 1-butanol from glucose. Directed evolution of {CimA} enhanced the specific activity over a wide temperature range (30 to 70 degrees C). The best {CimA} variant was found to be insensitive to feedback inhibition by isoleucine in addition to the improved activity. This {CimA} variant enabled 9- and 22-fold higher production levels of 1-propanol and 1-butanol, respectively, compared to the strain expressing the wild-type {CimA}. This work demonstrates (i) the first production of 1-propanol and 1-butanol using the citramalate pathway and (ii) the benefit of the 2-keto acid pathway that enables a growth-based evolutionary strategy to improve the production of non-growth-related products.},

Comparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates, as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. Here we demonstrate through metagenomic and biochemical analyses that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiota. Our results indicate that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet. Furthermore, this trait is transmissible: colonization of germ-free mice with an 'obese microbiota' results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a 'lean microbiota'. These results identify the gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity.},

In this review, we present the current understanding of the genetic regulation of secondary metabolism from clustering of biosynthetic genes to global regulators balancing growth, sporulation, and secondary metabolite production in selected fungi with emphasis on regulation of metabolites of agricultural concern. Particularly, the roles of G protein signaling components and developmental regulators in the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin biosynthesis in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans are discussed in depth.},

However, a precise evaluation of such suspected vertical microbiota transmission is yet to be performed. Here, we evaluated the microbiomes of four sample sets, each consisting of a mother's fecal and milk sample, and corresponding infant fecal sample, by means of amplicon-based profiling supported by shotgun metagenomics data of two key samples. Notably, targeted genome reconstruction from microbiome data revealed vertical transmission of a Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum strain from mother to infant, a notion confirmed by strain isolation and genome sequencing. Furthermore, {PCR} analyses targeting unique genes from these two strains highlighted their persistence in the infant gut at six months. Thus, this study demonstrates the existence of specific bifidobacterial strains that are common between mother and her child, thus indicative of vertical transmission, and that are maintained in the infant for at least relative short time spans.},

Modern high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools provide a powerful means of understanding the contribution of the human microbiome to health and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. This chapter will first discuss the historical origins of microbiome studies and methods for determining the ecological diversity of a microbial community. Next, it will introduce shotgun sequencing technologies such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the computational challenges and methods associated with these data, and how they enable microbiome analysis. Finally, it will conclude with examples of the functional genomics of the human microbiome and its influences upon health and disease.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms such as bacteria and molds produce an enormous variety of volatile metabolites. To determine whether typical microbial volatile metabolites can be used as indicator compounds for the detection of hidden mold in indoor environments, we examined 14 typical indoor fungal strains for their growth rates and their capability to produce volatile organic compounds ({VOC}) on standard clinical media and on agar medium made from building materials. Air samples from Headspace Chambers ({HSC}) were adsorbed daily on Tenax {TA} tubes and analyzed by thermal desorption gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. In parallel, metabolic activity was measured by determining oxygen demand, the microbial biomass was assessed by dry weighing. Profiling of the volatile metabolites showed that {VOC} production depended greatly on fungal strain, culture medium, biological activity, and time. The laboratory-derived maximum emission rates were extrapolated to approximate indoor air concentrations in a hypothetical mold-infested room. The extrapolated indoor air data suggest that most of the microbial-produced {VOC} concentrations were below the analytical detection limit for conventional indoor air analysis. Additionally, conducted indoor air analysis in mold homes confirmed these findings for the most part. The present findings raise doubts about the utility of indicator {VOC} for the detection of hidden mold growth in indoor environments. (© 2009 {WILEY}-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim)},

	abstract = {Growth efficiency and regulation of key enzyme activities were studied in carbon- and energy-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on mixtures of glucose and ethanol at a fixed dilution rate. Biomass yields on substrate carbon and oxygen could be adequately described as the net result of growth on the single substrates. Activities of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase were not detected in cell-free extracts of glucose-limited cultures. However, both enzymes were present when the ethanol fraction in the reservoir medium exceeded the theoretical minimum above which the glyoxylate cycle is required for anabolic reactions. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity was only detectable at high ethanol fractions in the feed, when activity of this enzyme was required for synthesis of hexose phosphates. Phospho-enol-pyruvate-carboxykinase activity was not detectable in extracts from glucose-grown cultures and increased with the ethanol fraction in the feed. It is concluded that, during carbon-limited growth of S. cerevisiae on mixtures of glucose and ethanol, biosynthetic intermediates with three or more carbon atoms are preferentially synthesized from glucose. Synthesis of the key enzymes of gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle is adapted to the cells' requirement for these intermediates. The gluconeogenic enzymes and their physiological antagonists (pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphofructokinase) were expressed simultaneously at high ethanol fractions in the feed. If futile cycling is prevented under these conditions, this is not primarily achieved by tight control of enzyme synthesis.},

Two proteins, {VeA} and {LaeA}, known to form a nuclear complex in Aspergillus nidulans have been found to positively regulate developmental processes in several Aspergillus species. Here, an examination of near-isogenic A. flavus mutants differing in copy number of {veA} and {laeA} alleles (0, 1, or at least 2 each) revealed critical roles for {VeA} and {LaeA} in A. flavus development and seed colonization. In contrast to the wild type, both null mutants were unable to metabolize host cell lipid reserves and were inhibited by oleic acid in growth assays. The copy number of {LaeA} but not {VeA} appeared critical for a density-dependent sclerotial-to-conidial shift, since the multicopy {laeA} ({MClaeA}) strain produced relatively constant sclerotial numbers with increasing population size rather than showing the decrease in sclerotia seen in both the wild-type and {MCveA} strains. The {MCveA}-{laeA} strain yielded an intermediate phenotype. This study revealed unique roles of {VeA} and {LaeA} in seed pathogenesis and fungal biology, distinct from their cooperative regulatory functions in aflatoxin and sclerotial development.},

This fungus exhibits varied pathogenicity lifestyles and the tools essential to understand the molecular mechanisms are still being developed. The transformation methods currently available for this species for gene discovery and functional analysis involve protoplast transformation and are laborious and inefficient. We have developed a protocol for efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation ({ATMT}) of C. acutatum. Using this protocol we were able to transform C. acutatum isolates belonging to different genetic groups and originating from different hosts. The transformation efficiency was up to 156 transformants per 104 conidia, with {\textgreater}70\% transformants showing single location/single copy integration of T-{DNA}. Binary vector {pBHt}2-{GFP} was constructed, enabling green fluorescence protein tagging of C. acutatum strains, which will be a useful tool for epidemiology and histopathology studies. The {ATMT} protocol developed was used to identify putative pathogenicity mutants, suggesting the applicability of this technique for rapid generation of a large panel of insertional mutants of C. acutatum leading to the identification of the genes associated with the varied lifestyles.},

The raft hypothesis is based on the behavior of defined lipid mixtures in liposomes and other model membranes. Experiments in these well-characterized systems led to operational definitions for lipid rafts in cell membranes. These definitions, detergent solubility to define components of rafts, and sensitivity to cholesterol deprivation to define raft functions implicated sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in many cell functions. Despite extensive work, the basis for raft formation in cell membranes and the size of rafts and their stability are all uncertain. Recent work converges on very small rafts {\textless}10 nm in diameter that may enlarge and stabilize when their constituents are cross-linked.},

	abstract = {The available genomic sequences of three pathogenic and three nonpathogenic bacteria were analyzed to identify known and putative drug-specific and multidrug resistance transport systems. Escherichia coli was found to encode 29 such pumps, and with the exception of the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii, the numbers of multidrug efflux pumps encoded within genomes of the other organisms were found to be approximately proportional to their total numbers of encoded transport systems as well as to total genome size. The similar numbers of chromosomally encoded multidrug efflux systems in pathogens and nonpathogens suggests that these transporters have not arisen recently in pathogens in response to antimicrobial chemotherapy. Phylogenetic analyses of the four transporter families that contain drug efflux permeases indicate that drug resistance arose rarely during the evolution of each family and that the diversity of current drug efflux pumps within each family arose from just one or a very few primordial systems. However, although the ability to confer drug efflux appears to have emerged on only a few occasions in evolutionary time and was stably maintained as an evolutionary trait, modulation of the substrate specificities of these systems has occurred repeatedly. A speculative model is presented that may explain the apparent capability of these multidrug transport systems to mediate drug transport from the cytoplasm or directly from the phospholipid bilayer.--Saier, M.

	abstract = {The Anelloviridae family consists of non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded {DNA} viruses. Three genera of anellovirus are known to infect humans, named {TTV}, {TTMDV}, and {TTMV}. Although anelloviruses were initially thought to cause non-A-G viral hepatitis, continued research has shown no definitive associations between anellovirus and human disease to date. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients 2-36 months of age. We determined that although anelloviruses were present in a large number of specimens from both febrile and afebrile patients, they were more prevalent in the plasma and nasopharyngeal ({NP}) specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. Using {PCR} to detect each of the three species of anellovirus that infect humans, we found that anellovirus species {TTV} and {TTMDV} were more prevalent in the plasma and {NP} specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. This was not the case for species {TTMV} which was found in similar percentages of febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of plasma and {NP} specimens containing anellovirus increased with age until patients were 19-24 months of age, after which the percentage of anellovirus positive patient specimens dropped. This trend was striking for {TTV} and {TTMDV} and very modest for {TTMV} in both plasma and {NP} specimens. Finally, as the temperature of febrile patients increased, so too did the frequency of {TTV} and {TTMDV} detection. Again, {TTMV} was equally present in both febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Taken together these data indicate that the human anellovirus species {TTV} and {TTMDV} are associated with fever in children, while the highly related human anellovirus {TTMV} has no association with fever.},

	abstract = {One approach to reducing the costs of advanced biofuel production from cellulosic biomass is to engineer a single microorganism to both digest plant biomass and produce hydrocarbons that have the properties of petrochemical fuels. Such an organism would require pathways for hydrocarbon production and the capacity to secrete sufficient enzymes to efficiently hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. To demonstrate how one might engineer and coordinate all of the necessary components for a biomass-degrading, hydrocarbon-producing microorganism, we engineered a microorganism naïve to both processes, Escherichia coli, to grow using both the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of several types of plant biomass pretreated with ionic liquids. Our engineered strains express cellulase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, and xylobiosidase enzymes under control of native E. coli promoters selected to optimize growth on model cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates. Furthermore, our strains grow using either the cellulose or hemicellulose components of ionic liquid-pretreated biomass or on both components when combined as a coculture. Both cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic strains were further engineered with three biofuel synthesis pathways to demonstrate the production of fuel substitutes or precursors suitable for gasoline, diesel, and jet engines directly from ionic liquid-treated switchgrass without externally supplied hydrolase enzymes. This demonstration represents a major advance toward realizing a consolidated bioprocess. With improvements in both biofuel synthesis pathways and biomass digestion capabilities, our approach could provide an economical route to production of advanced biofuels.},

Krazy Glue and Histoacryl were used in opposite ears, harvesting specimens at 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks. The Krazy Glue-treated ears developed seromas with histologic evidence of acute inflammation, tissue necrosis, and chronic foreign body giant cell reaction. The Histoacryl-treated ears showed mild acute inflammation and mild foreign body giant cell reaction.

Of the 16 species identified, one endophyte Pleuroplaconema sp. was isolated most frequently from all sites, being detected in 55.4\%-74.6\% of leaves. The lowest percentage of Pleuroplaconema sp. at the southernmost site also had the lowest total infection frequency with 18.6\% of leaves being uninfected. Redwood at all other sites had between 1-4\% frequency of uninfected leaves. Other species with consistent presence in the redwood populations were: Cryptosporiopsis abietina, Phomopsis occulta, Hypoxylon bipapillatum, Gelatinosporium sp., Nodulisporium sp., Geniculosporium sp, Aureobasidium sp., and Phlyctema sp. The relatively constant endophyte composition in Sequoia sempervirens leaves along this north to south transect provides a basis to explore the mutualistic, pathogenic and saprobic nature of these endophytic relationships.},

	abstract = {In view of rising prices of crude oil due to increasing fuel demands, the need for alternative sources of bioenergy is expected to increase sharply in the coming years. Among potential alternative bioenergy resources, lignocellulosics have been identified as the prime source of biofuels and other value-added products. Lignocelluloses as agricultural, industrial and forest residuals account for the majority of the total biomass present in the world. To initiate the production of industrially important products from cellulosic biomass, bioconversion of the cellulosic components into fermentable sugars is necessary. A variety of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi may have the ability to degrade the cellulosic biomass to glucose monomers. Bacterial cellulases exist as discrete multi-enzyme complexes, called cellulosomes that consist of multiple subunits. Cellulolytic enzyme systems from the filamentous fungi, especially Trichoderma reesei, contain two exoglucanases or cellobiohydrolases ({CBH}1 and {CBH}2), at least four endoglucanases ({EG}1, {EG}2, {EG}3, {EG}5), and one beta-glucosidase. These enzymes act synergistically to catalyse the hydrolysis of cellulose. Different physical parameters such as {pH}, temperature, adsorption, chemical factors like nitrogen, phosphorus, presence of phenolic compounds and other inhibitors can critically influence the bioconversion of lignocellulose. The production of cellulases by microbial cells is governed by genetic and biochemical controls including induction, catabolite repression, or end product inhibition. Several efforts have been made to increase the production of cellulases through strain improvement by mutagenesis. Various physical and chemical methods have been used to develop bacterial and fungal strains producing higher amounts of cellulase, all with limited success. Cellulosic bioconversion is a complex process and requires the synergistic action of the three enzymatic components consisting of endoglucanases, exoglucanases and beta-glucosidases. The co-cultivation of microbes in fermentation can increase the quantity of the desirable components of the cellulase complex. An understanding of the molecular mechanism leading to biodegradation of lignocelluloses and the development of the bioprocessing potential of cellulolytic microorganisms might effectively be accomplished with recombinant {DNA} technology. For instance, cloning and sequencing of the various cellulolytic genes could economize the cellulase production process. Apart from that, metabolic engineering and genomics approaches have great potential for enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanism of bioconversion of lignocelluloses to value added economically significant products in the future.},

Moreover, sequence reads from a specific individual can contain sufficient information to potentially identify and genetically characterize that person, raising privacy concerns. In order to address these issues we have developed the Mapped Read Format ({MRF}), a compact data summary format for both short and long read alignments that enables the anonymization of confidential sequence information, while allowing one to still carry out many functional genomics studies. We have developed a suite of tools that use this format for the analysis of {RNA}-Seq experiments. {RSEQtools} consists of a set of modules that perform common tasks such as calculating gene expression values, generating signal tracks of mapped reads, and segmenting that signal into actively transcribed regions. Moreover, these tools can readily be used to build customizable {RNA}-Seq workflows. In addition to the anonymization afforded by this format it also facilitates the decoupling of the alignment of reads from downstream analyses.Availability and implementation: {RSEQtools} is implemented in C and the source code is available at http://rseqtools.gersteinlab.org/Contact: lukas.habegger@yale.edu mark.gerstein@yale.{eduSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Without refinement, {MUSCLE} achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and {MAFFT}, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. The {MUSCLE} program, source code and {PREFAB} test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.},

	abstract = {Fungi are a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites, and mushroom-forming fungi (Agaricomycetes) are especially known for the synthesis of numerous bioactive and often cytotoxic sesquiterpenoid secondary metabolites. Compared with the large number of sesquiterpene synthases identified in plants, less than a handful of unique sesquiterpene synthases have been described from fungi. Here we describe the functional characterization of six sesquiterpene synthases (Cop1 to Cop6) and two terpene-oxidizing cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cox1 and Cox2) from Coprinus cinereus. The genes were cloned and, except for cop5, functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and/or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cop1 and Cop2 each synthesize germacrene A as the major product. Cop3 was identified as an alpha-muurolene synthase, an enzyme that has not been described previously, while Cop4 synthesizes delta-cadinene as its major product. Cop6 was originally annotated as a trichodiene synthase homologue but instead was found to catalyse the highly specific synthesis of alpha-cuprenene. Coexpression of cop6 and the two monooxygenase genes next to it yields oxygenated alpha-cuprenene derivatives, including cuparophenol, suggesting that these genes encode the enzymes for the biosynthesis of antimicrobial quinone sesquiterpenoids (known as lagopodins) that were previously isolated from C. cinereus and other Coprinus species.},

Functions like the accumulation of rhodamine 123, [beta]-estradiol, fluconazole and floppase activity associated with Cdr1p were measured to ascertain their responses to an altered membrane phase. The floppase activity appeared to be favoured by an enhanced membrane fluidity, while the effluxing of substrates and Cdr1p's ability to confer multidrug resistance were significantly reduced. We demonstrate that only some of the functions of Cdr1p were affected by an altered lipid environment.},

These metabolic changes correlated with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and transfer of the gut microbiota from {TLR}5-deficient mice to wild-type germ-free mice conferred many features of metabolic syndrome to the recipients. Food restriction prevented obesity, but not insulin resistance, in the {TLR}5-deficient mice. These results support the emerging view that the gut microbiota contributes to metabolic disease and suggest that malfunction of the innate immune system may promote the development of metabolic syndrome.},

Recent advances in {DNA} sequencing technologies make possible comprehensive studies of the time-dependent behavior of microbes throughout the body. Sophisticated computer-based methods are essential for the analysis and interpretation of these complex datasets. We present a computational method that models how human microbial ecosystems respond over time to perturbations, such as when subjects in a study are treated with a drug. When applied to a large publicly available dataset, our method yields new insights into the diversity of dynamic responses to antibiotics among microbes in the human body. We find that within an individual, sub-populations of microbes that share certain physiological roles also share coordinated responses. Moreover, we find that these responses are similar across different people. We use this information to improve the experimental design of the previously conducted study, and to develop strategies for optimal design of future studies. Our work provides an integrated computer-based method for automatically discovering patterns of change over time in the microbiota, and for designing future experiments to identify changes that impact human health and disease.},

The aldehyde decarbonylase is related to the broadly functional nonheme diiron enzymes. Heterologous expression of the alkane operon in Escherichia coli leads to the production and secretion of C13 to C17 mixtures of alkanes and alkenes. These genes and enzymes can now be leveraged for the simple and direct conversion of renewable raw materials to fungible hydrocarbon fuels.},

Additionally, certain iridoids are used as sex pheromones in agriculturally important species of aphids, a fact that has underpinned innovative and integrated pest management strategies. To harness the biotechnological potential of this natural product class, the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway must be elucidated. Here we report the discovery of iridoid synthase, a plant-derived enzyme that generates the iridoid ring scaffold, as evidenced by biochemical assays, gene silencing, co-expression analysis and localization studies. In contrast to all known monoterpene cyclases, which use geranyl diphosphate as substrate and invoke a cationic intermediate, iridoid synthase uses the linear monoterpene 10-oxogeranial as substrate and probably couples an initial {NAD}(P)H-dependent reduction step with a subsequent cyclization step via a Diels–Alder cycloaddition or a Michael addition. Our results illustrate how a short-chain reductase was recruited as cyclase for the production of iridoids in medicinal plants. Furthermore, we highlight the prospects of using unrelated reductases to generate artificial cyclic scaffolds. Beyond the recognition of an alternative biochemical mechanism for the biosynthesis of cyclic terpenes, we anticipate that our work will enable the large-scale heterologous production of iridoids in plants and microorganisms for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.},

	abstract = {We examined endophytic fungi in asymptomatic foliage of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) in North Carolina, {USA}, with four goals: (i) to evaluate morphotaxa, {BLAST} matches and groups based on sequence similarity as functional taxonomic units; (ii) to explore methods to maximize phylogenetic signal for environmental datasets, which typically contain many taxa but few characters; (iii) to compare culturing vs. culture-free methods (environmental {PCR} of surface sterilized foliage) for estimating endophyte diversity and species composition; and (iv) to investigate the relationships between traditional ecological indices (e.g. Shannon index) and phylogenetic diversity ({PD}) in estimating endophyte diversity and spatial heterogeneity. Endophytes were recovered in culture from 87 of 90 P. taeda leaves sampled, yielding 439 isolates that represented 24 morphotaxa. Sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) for 150 isolates revealed 59 distinct {ITS} genotypes that represented 24 and 37 unique groups based on 90\% and 95\% sequence similarity, respectively. By recoding ambiguously aligned regions to extract phylogenetic signal and implementing a conservative phylogenetic backbone constraint, we recovered well supported phylogenies based on ca. 600 bp of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit ({LSUrDNA}) for 72 Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, 145 cultured endophytes and 33 environmental {PCR} samples. Comparisons with {LSUrDNA}-delimited species showed that morphotaxa adequately estimated total species richness but rarely corresponded to biologically meaningful groups. {ITS} {BLAST} results were variable in their utility, but {ITS} genotype groups based on 90\% sequence similarity were concordant with {LSUrDNA}-delimited species. Environmental {PCR} yielded more genotypes per sampling effort and recovered several distinct clades relative to culturing, but some commonly cultured clades were never found (Sordariomycetes) or were rare relative to their high frequency among cultures (Leotiomycetes). In contrast to traditional indices, {PD} demonstrated spatial heterogeneity in endophyte assemblages among P. taeda trees and study plots. Our results highlight the need for caution in designating taxonomic units based on gross cultural morphology or {ITS} {BLAST} matches, the utility of phylogenetic tools for extracting robust phylogenies from environmental samples, the complementarity of culturing and environmental {PCR}, the utility of {PD} relative to traditional ecological indices, and the remarkably high diversity of foliar fungal endophytes in this simplified temperate ecosystem.},

Evidence was obtained which indicates that metabolism of delta 4-{VPA} by each of these enzyme systems can lead to the generation of chemically reactive intermediates which may contribute to the hepatotoxic properties of {VPA}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus niger have a high capacity secretory system and are therefore widely exploited for the industrial production of native and heterologous proteins. However, in most cases the yields of non-fungal proteins are significantly lower than those obtained for fungal proteins. One well-studied bottleneck appears to be the result of mis-folding of heterologous proteins in the {ER} during early stages of secretion, with related stress responses in the host, including the unfolded protein response ({UPR}). This study aims at uncovering transcriptional and translational responses occurring in A. niger exposed to secretion stress. {RESULTS}: A genome-wide transcriptional analysis of protein secretion-related stress responses was determined using Affymetrix {DNA} {GeneChips} and independent verification for selected genes. Endoplasmic reticulum ({ER})-associated stress was induced either by chemical treatment of the wild-type cells with dithiothreitol ({DTT}) or tunicamycin, or by expressing a human protein, tissue plasminogen activator (t-{PA}). All of these treatments triggered the {UPR}, as shown by the expression levels of several well-known {UPR} target genes. The predicted proteins encoded by most of the up-regulated genes function as part of the secretory system including chaperones, foldases, glycosylation enzymes, vesicle transport proteins, and {ER}-associated degradation proteins. Several genes were down-regulated under stress conditions and these included several genes that encode secreted enzymes. Moreover, translational regulation under {ER} stress was investigated by polysomal fractionation. This analysis confirmed the post-transcriptional control of {hacA} expression and highlighted that differential translation also occurs during {ER} stress, in particular for some genes encoding secreted proteins or proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis and assembly. {CONCLUSION}: This is first genome-wide analysis of both transcriptional and translational events following protein secretion stress. Insight has been gained into the molecular basis of protein secretion and secretion-related stress in an effective protein-secreting fungus, and provides an opportunity to identify target genes for manipulation in strain improvement strategies.},

Composition of L. nobilis essential oil included large amounts of monoterpenes, mainly oxygenated derivatives, while in C. bergamia essential oil limonene was the main compound followed by linalyl acetate and γ-terpinene and linalool. In lavandin oil there was a prevalence of linalool and linalyl acetate, while phenyl propanoids were the main compounds detected in fennel essential oil. Two kinds of bioassays were performed: filter paper tests, carried out in Petri dishes on all three coleopteran species and tests on treated kernels carried out only on S. zeamais adults. In filter paper bioassays, essential oils showed different activity: on S. zeamais, fennel after 3 h of exposure and bergamot after 24 h exerted the highest repellency, similar results were obtained for C. ferrugineus, but lavandin also showed good repellent activity, while for T. molitor larvae bay laurel was the most effective repellent. Repellency tests on kernels against S. zeamais adults suggested that bergamot and lavandin were the most efficient oils. Even if laboratory bioassays are only the first step towards use of essential oils in practical applications, these substances do represent a possible alternative to chemical insecticides in some market niches.},

Two trapping products, namely the trimethylsilyl ether/ester derivatives of the hemiacetal 12-(1'-hydroxy-3'-hexenyloxy)-9,11-dodecadienoic acid and the enol (9Z,11E)-12-hydroxy-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) analyses. The structural assignments were supported by mass spectra recorded for (a) hydrogenated products; (b) products biosynthesized from [9,10,12,13,15,16] 13-{HPOT} or [18O2]13-{HPOT}; (c) chemically prepared reference compounds.

Pezizomycetes and Dothideomycetes also were resolved as monophyletic but not strongly supported by the data. Lecanoromycetes was resolved as paraphyletic in parsimony analyses but monophyletic in maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. Leotiomycetes was polyphyletic due to exclusion of Geoglossaceae. The two most basal classes of Pezizomycotina were Orbiliomycetes and Pezizomycetes, both of which comprise species that produce apothecial ascomata. The seven remaining classes formed a monophyletic group that corresponds to Leotiomyceta.

We review several potential mechanisms for microbial control over eating behavior including microbial influence on reward and satiety pathways, production of toxins that alter mood, changes to receptors including taste receptors, and hijacking of the vagus nerve, the neural axis between the gut and the brain. We also review the evidence for alternative explanations for cravings and unhealthy eating behavior. Because microbiota are easily manipulatable by prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, fecal transplants, and dietary changes, altering our microbiota offers a tractable approach to otherwise intractable problems of obesity and unhealthy eating.},

	abstract = {The trillions of microbes that colonize our adult intestines function collectively as a metabolic organ that communicates with, and complements, our own human metabolic apparatus. Given the worldwide epidemic in obesity, there is interest in how interactions between human and microbial metabolomes may affect our energy balance. Here we report that, in contrast to mice with a gut microbiota, germ-free ({GF}) animals are protected against the obesity that develops after consuming a Western-style, high-fat, sugar-rich diet. Their persistently lean phenotype is associated with increased skeletal muscle and liver levels of phosphorylated {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) and its downstream targets involved in fatty acid oxidation ({acetylCoA} carboxylase; carnitine-palmitoyltransferase). Moreover, {GF} knockout mice lacking fasting-induced adipose factor (Fiaf), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor whose expression is normally selectively suppressed in the gut epithelium by the microbiota, are not protected from diet-induced obesity. Although {GF} Fiaf−/− animals exhibit similar levels of phosphorylated {AMPK} as their wild-type littermates in liver and gastrocnemius muscle, they have reduced expression of genes encoding the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (Pgc-1α) and enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Thus, {GF} animals are protected from diet-induced obesity by two complementary but independent mechanisms that result in increased fatty acid metabolism: (i) elevated levels of Fiaf, which induces Pgc-1α; and (ii) increased {AMPK} activity. Together, these findings support the notion that the gut microbiota can influence both sides of the energy balance equation, and underscore the importance of considering our metabolome in a supraorganismal context.},

	abstract = {A method for measuring the stereospecific uptake of d-glucose by isolated human erythrocyte membranes has recently been developed in our laboratory (Kahlenberg, A., Urman, B., and Dolansky, D. (1971) Biochemistry, 10,3154). Data obtained with this method were interpreted to suggest that the uptake activity measured represented the binding of d-glucose to a specific site on the erythrocyte membrane. To investigate the possible role of phospholipids in this d-glucose uptake activity, the phospholipid structure of erythrocyte membranes was modified by treatment with phospholipase A2, C, or D, and the effect of each modification on their d-glucose uptake activity and phospholipid composition was determined. Phospholipase A2 treatment produced a maximum decrease in uptake activity of 75\% in association with the hydrolysis of approximately 74\% of the total available \{beta\}-fatty acid ester linkages of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine; the maximum hydrolysis of these phospholipids obtainable was 91\%. In contrast, hydrolysis of approximately 64\% and 46\% of the membrane phospholipid phosphodiester linkages by phospholipase C and D, respectively, resulted in only a 25\% decrease in d-glucose uptake activity. Likewise a greater decrease in the activity of the erythrocyte membrane (sodium plus potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase was observed after phospholipase A2 than after phospholipase C or D treatment. Acetylcholinesterase activity of the membrane was not affected by any of these phospholipolytic enzymes.The above results suggest that perturbation of phospholipid hydrophobic groups in the interior of the membrane, proximal or hydrophobically bound to membrane proteins, causes a decrease in the d-glucose uptake activity of these proteins.},

Modern high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools provide a powerful means of understanding the contribution of the human microbiome to health and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. This chapter will first discuss the historical origins of microbiome studies and methods for determining the ecological diversity of a microbial community. Next, it will introduce shotgun sequencing technologies such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the computational challenges and methods associated with these data, and how they enable microbiome analysis. Finally, it will conclude with examples of the functional genomics of the human microbiome and its influences upon health and disease.},

	abstract = {The biosynthetic gene cluster for the enediyne antitumor antibiotic maduropeptin ({MDP}) from Actinomadura madurae {ATCC} 39144 was cloned and sequenced. Cloning of the mdp gene cluster was confirmed by heterologous complementation of enediyne polyketide synthase ({PKS}) mutants from the C-1027 producer Streptomyces globisporus and the neocarzinostatin producer Streptomyces carzinostaticus using the {MDP} enediyne {PKS} and associated genes. Furthermore, {MDP} was produced, and its apoprotein was isolated and N-terminal sequenced; the encoding gene, {mdpA}, was found to reside within the cluster. The biosynthesis of {MDP} is highlighted by two iterative type I {PKSs} - the enediyne {PKS} and a 6-methylsalicylic acid {PKS}; generation of (S)-3-(2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4- methoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid derived from L-α-tyrosine; a unique type of enediyne apoprotein; and a convergent biosynthetic approach to the final {MDP} chromophore. The results demonstrate a platform for engineering new enediynes by combinatorial biosynthesis and establish a unified paradigm for the biosynthesis of enediyne polyketides. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

It is an efflux transporter that can bind and transport cytoplasmic {QACs} into the periplasm using the energy of the proton gradient across the inner membrane. Isothermal titration calorimetry provides information about the stoichiometry and thermodynamic properties of protein-ligand interactions, and can be used to monitor the binding of {QACs} to {EmrE} in different membrane mimetic environments. In this study the ligand binding to {EmrE} solubilized in dodecyl maltoside, sodium dodecyl sulfate and reconstituted into small unilamellar vesicles is examined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding stoichiometry of {EmrE} to drug was found to be 1:1, demonstrating that oligomerization of {EmrE} is not necessary for binding to drug. The binding of {EmrE} to drug was observed with the dissociation constant ({KD}) in the micromolar range for each of the drugs in any of the membrane mimetic environments. Thermodynamic properties demonstrated this interaction to be enthalpy-driven with similar enthalpies of 8-12 kcal/mol for each of the drugs in any of the membrane mimetics.},

We engineered microbial production of the full range of even-and odd-chain-length {MCFAs} and found that {MCFA} production is limited by rapid, irreversible elongation of their acyl-{ACP} precursors. To address this limitation, we programmed an essential ketoacyl synthase to degrade in response to a chemical inducer, thereby slowing acyl-{ACP} elongation and redirecting flux from phospholipid synthesis to {MCFA} production. Our results show that induced protein degradation can be used to dynamically alter metabolic flux, and thereby increase the yield of a desired compound. The strategy reported herein should be widely useful in a range of metabolic engineering applications in which essential enzymes divert flux away from a desired product, as well as in the production of polyketides, bioplastics, and other recursively synthesized hydrocarbons for which chain-length control is desired.},

	abstract = {Author Summary A renewable source of energy is a pressing global need. The biological conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels by microorganisms presents a promising avenue, but few organisms have been studied thoroughly enough to develop the genetic tools necessary for rigorous experimentation. The filamentous-fungal endophyte A. sarcoides produces metabolites when grown on a cellulose-based medium that include eight-carbon volatile organic compounds, which are potential biofuel targets. Here we use broadly applicable methods including genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to explore the biofuel production of A. sarcoides. These data were used to assemble the genome into 16 scaffolds, to thoroughly annotate the cellulose-degradation machinery, and to make predictions for the production pathway for the eight-carbon volatiles. Extremely high expression of the gene swollenin when grown on cellulose highlights the importance of accessory proteins in addition to the enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of the polymers. Correlation of the production of the eight-carbon biofuel-like metabolites with the expression of lipoxygenase pathway genes suggests the catabolism of linoleic acid as the mechanism of eight-carbon compound production. This is the first fungal genome to be sequenced in the family Helotiaceae, and A. sarcoides was isolated as an endophyte, making this work also potentially useful in fungal systematics and the study of plant–fungus relationships.},

	abstract = {Leaf endophytic fungi were isolated from 1 to 12-yr-old leaves of mature trees and basal sprouts of coastal redwood [Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don ex Lamb.) Endl.] in a redwood forest in Central California. Almost all samples yielded at least one species. The two most frequent species were Pleuroplaconema sp. and Cryptosporiopsis abietina Petrak. Among isolated taxa are endophytic generalists, species previously known as pathogens and a possible specialist. Species composition in leaves of progressing age in single branches revealed a patchy pattern of leaf colonization without an obvious sequence of succession. Changes in diversity and equitability in the endophytic community with leaf age are linked with differential distribution of some species in young versus old leaves and the increase in species richness in 4- and 5-yr-old leaves. The endophytic communities from leaves of trees and sprouts were generally similar, but with important differences in species richness and in distribution of Pleuroplaconema sp. and Pestalotiopsis funerea (Desm.) Stey. Principal component analysis based on endophytic frequency also indicated closeness of trees and sprouts as groups, but clearly separated each tree from its sprout. Differential susceptibility between trees and sprouts to endophytic infection is suggested on the basis of their endophytic communities.},

{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}—Data on diabetes prevalence by age and sex from a limited number of countries were extrapolated to all 191 World Health Organization member states and applied to United Nations’ population estimates for 2000 and 2030. Urban and rural populations were considered separately for developing countries.
{RESULTS}—The prevalence of diabetes for all age-groups worldwide was estimated to be 2.8\% in 2000 and 4.4\% in 2030. The total number of people with diabetes is projected to rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030. The prevalence of diabetes is higher in men than women, but there are more women with diabetes than men. The urban population in developing countries is projected to double between 2000 and 2030. The most important demographic change to diabetes prevalence across the world appears to be the increase in the proportion of people {\textgreater}65 years of age.
{CONCLUSIONS}—These findings indicate that the “diabetes epidemic” will continue even if levels of obesity remain constant. Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, it is likely that these figures provide an underestimate of future diabetes prevalence.},

Ten normal subjects (six males and four females, with an average age of 34 +/- 6 yr) were involved in this study. Eucalyptamint was applied to the anterior forearm skin of one side, and placebo was applied to the contralateral forearm. The subjective feelings, cutaneous blood flow, and skin temperature were measured before and periodically (5-min intervals) after the application of the compound. Muscle temperature was measured before and 30 min after the application of the Eucalyptamint. There was no significant effect on the subjective sensation. However, there were statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increases in cutaneous blood flow (up to 4 times base-line) and skin temperatures (up to 0.8 degrees C higher than base-line) after the application of Eucalyptamint with the effects lasting up to 45 min after the application. The muscle temperature was also increased (0.4 degrees C) significantly (P less than 0.05) 30 min after application of the Eucalyptamint. There were no significant changes in the placebo application. The results of this study suggested that the new product of counterirritant, Eucalyptamint, produced significant physiologic responses that may be beneficial for pain relief and/or useful to athletes as a passive form of warm-up.},

One low-stringency {PCR} cycle is carried out to create annealing site(s) adapted for the arbitrary primer within the unknown target sequence bordering the known segment. This sequence is then preferentially and geometrically amplified over nontarget ones by interspersion of high-stringency {PCR} cycles with reduced-stringency {PCR} cycles.

In the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 251/2 years from 01/1981 to 06/2006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to 06/2006 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a ?natural product mimic? or ?{NM}? to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from around the 1940s to date, of the 155 small molecules, 73\% are other than ?S? (synthetic), with 47\% actually being either natural products or directly derived therefrom. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, with, as expected from prior information, the antiinfective area being dependent on natural products and their structures. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 25 plus year time frame. We wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the ?host from whence it was isolated?, and therefore we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.},

After fumigation of the grapes with ozone or sulfur dioxide during pre-cooling, the fruit were then exposed to continuous biofumigation by the volatile-producing fungus Muscodor albus during storage. Biofumigation was provided by in-package generators containing a live grain culture of the fungus. This grain formulation of M. albus survived the initial ozone or sulfur dioxide fumigation, but sulfur dioxide reduced its production of isobutyric acid, an indicator of the production of antifungal volatiles. Gray mold incidence was reduced among inoculated ‘Autumn Seedless’ grapes from 91.7 to 19.3\% by 1 h fumigation with 5000 μL L−1 ozone, and further reduced to 10.0\% when ozone fumigation and M. albus biofumigation were combined. The natural incidence of gray mold among organically grown ‘Thompson Seedless’ grapes after 1 month of storage at 0.5 °C was 31.0\%. Ozone fumigation and M. albus biofumigation reduced the incidence of gray mold to 9.7 and 4.4, respectively, while the combined treatment reduced gray mold incidence to 3.4\%. The use of commercial sulfur dioxide pads reduced the incidence to 1.1\%. The combination of ozone and M. albus controlled decay significantly, but was less effective than the standard sulfur dioxide treatments. Although less effective than sulfur dioxide treatment, ozone and M. albus controlled decay significantly, and could be alternatives to sulfur dioxide, particularly for growers complying with organic production requirements.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The controversial issue of the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is examined, employing a decision analytic method.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

The {NSAS}, {NHDS} (National Center for Health Statistics), {HCUP}-{NIS} (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases and 51 randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The study group constituted of a total of 1,513,008 hernia repairs. Projection of the clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes expected from the different treatment options was done by using a Markov Monte Carlo decision model. Two logistic regression models were used to predict the probability of hospital admission after an ambulatory procedure and the probability of death after inguinal hernia repair. Four treatment strategies were modeled: (1) laparoscopic repair ({LR}), (2) open mesh ({OM}), (3) open non-mesh ({ONM}), and (4) expectant management. Costs were expressed in {US} dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}). The main outcome measures were the average and the incremental cost-effectiveness ({ICER}) ratios.


{RESULTS}

Compared to the expectant management, the incremental cost per {QALY} gained was 605 dollars (4086 dollars, 9.04 {QALYs}) for {LR}, 697 dollars (4290 dollars, 8.975 {QALYs}) for {OM}, and 1711 dollars (6200 dollars, 8.546 {QALYs}) for {ONM}. In sensitivity analysis the two major components that affect the cost-effectiveness ratio of the different types of repair were the ambulatory facility cost and the recurrence rate. At a {LR} ambulatory facility cost of 5526 dollars the {ICER} of {LR} compared to {OM} surpasses the threshold of 50,000 dollars/{QALY}.


{CONCLUSIONS}

On the basis of our assumptions this mathematical model shows that from a societal perspective laparoscopic approach can be a cost-effective treatment option for inguinal hernia repair.},

Isobutyraldehyde is a precursor for the synthesis of other chemicals, and isobutanol can be used as a gasoline substitute. The high vapor pressure of isobutyraldehyde allows in situ product recovery and reduces product toxicity. The engineered strain remained active for 8 d and produced isobutyraldehyde at a higher rate than those reported for ethanol, hydrogen or lipid production by cyanobacteria or algae. These results underscore the promise of direct bioconversion of {CO}2 into fuels and chemicals, which bypasses the need for deconstruction of biomass.},

	abstract = {Ca2+-{ATPase} can be purified from the skeletal muscle of sarcoplasmic reticulum and reconstituted into phospholipid bilayers of defined composition. This allows a detailed study of the interactions between phospholipid molecules and the {ATPase}, and of the effects of phospholipid structure on the activity of the {ATPase}. It has been shown that the thickness of the lipid bilayer, its physical phase and the lipid headgroup structure can all be important. The interaction between phospholipids and the {ATPase} is not structurally specific in that the strength of the phospholipid-{ATPase} interaction does not depend on headgroup structure or on fatty acyl chain length, but the strength of binding is different for liquid crystalline and gel phase lipid. There are also ‘specific’ sites for some lipids on the {ATPase}. There is no unique mechanism explaining the effects of phospholipid on the function of the {ATPase}; the changes observed with any particular phospholipid follow from a distinct set of changes in the conformational state of the {ATPase}. The changes in activity are likely to follow from tilting of trans-membrane α-helices in the {ATPase}. In simple model systems it has been shown that the extent to which lipids can distort to match the protein is limited.

	abstract = {Assessment and characterization of gut microbiota has become a major research area in human disease, including type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent endocrine disease worldwide. To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study ({MGWAS}) and undertook a two-stage {MGWAS} based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial {DNA} from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. {MGWAS} analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei produces and secretes profuse quantities of enzymes that act synergistically to degrade cellulase and related biomass components. We partially sequenced over 5100 random T. reesei {cDNA} clones. Among the sequences whose predicted gene products had significant similarity to known proteins, 12 were identified that encode previously unknown enzymes that likely function in biomass degradation. Microarrays were used to query the expression levels of each of the sequences under different conditions known to induce cellulolytic enzyme synthesis. Most of the genes encoding known and putative biomass-degrading enzymes were transcriptionally co-regulated. Moreover, despite the fact that several of these enzymes are not thought to degrade cellulase directly, they were coordinately overexpressed in a cellulase overproducing strain. A variety of additional sequences whose function could not be ascribed using the limited sequence available displayed analogous behavior and may also play a role in biomass degradation or in the synthesis of biomass-degrading enzymes. Sequences exhibiting additional regulatory patterns were observed that might reflect roles in regulation of cellulase biosynthesis. However, genes whose products are involved in protein processing and secretion were not highly regulated during cellulase induction. {FIG}2"{\textgreater} {WIDTH}=182 {HEIGHT}=200 {SRC}="/small/bc3236788002.gif" {ALT}=" "{\textgreater} View larger version (50K): {FIG}2"{\textgreater}[in this window] {FIG}2" {onClick}="{startTarget}('{FIG}2', 550, 640); this.href='{FIG}2'" {onMouseOver}="window.status='View figure in a separate window'; return true" {TARGET}="{FIG}2"{\textgreater}[in a new window] {FIG}. 2.

	abstract = {In contrast to most primary metabolism genes, the genes involved in secondary metabolism and certain nutrient utilization pathways are clustered in fungi. Recently a nuclear protein, {LaeA}, was found to be required for the transcription of several secondary metabolite gene clusters in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we show that {LaeA} regulation does not extend to nutrient utilization or the {spoC}1 sporulation clusters. One of the secondary metabolite clusters regulated by {LaeA} contains the positive regulatory (i.e. {aflR}) and biosynthetic genes required for biosynthesis of sterigmatocystin ({ST}), a carcinogenic toxin. Analysis of {ST} gene cluster expression indicates {LaeA} regulation of the cluster is location specific as transcription of genes bordering the {ST} cluster are unaffected in a 0394laeA mutant and placement of a primary metabolic gene, {argB}, in the {ST} cluster resulted in {argB} silencing in the 0394laeA background. {ST} cluster gene expression was remediated when an additional copy of {aflR} was placed outside of the cluster but not when placed in the cluster. Site-specific mutation of an s-adenosyl methionine ({AdoMet}) binding site in {LaeA} generated a 0394laeA phenotype suggesting the protein to be a methyltransferase.},

	abstract = {Penicillium paneum is an important contaminant of cereal grains which is able to grow at low temperature, low {pH}, high levels of carbon dioxide, and under acid conditions. P. paneum produces mycotoxins, which may be harmful to animals and humans. We found that conidia in dense suspensions showed poor germination, suggesting the presence of a self-inhibitor. A volatile compound(s) produced by these high-density conditions also inhibited mycelial growth of different species of fungi belonging to a variety of genera, suggesting a broad action range. The heat-stable compound was isolated by successive centrifugation of the supernatant obtained from spore suspensions with a density of 10(9) conidia ml(-1). By using static headspace analyses, two major peaks were distinguished, with the highest production of these metabolites after 22 h of incubation at 25 degrees C and shaking at 140 rpm. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectra analysis revealed the compounds to be 3-octanone and 1-octen-3-ol. Notably, only the latter compound appeared to block the germination process at different developmental stages of the conidia (swelling and germ tube formation). In this study, 1-octen-3-ol influenced different developmental processes during the P. paneum life cycle, including induction of microcycle conidiation and inhibition of spore germination. Therefore, the compound can be considered a fungal hormone during fungal development.},

The used cooking oils are used as raw material, adaption of continuous transesterification process and recovery of high quality glycerol from biodiesel by-product (glycerol) are primary options to be considered to lower the cost of biodiesel. There are four primary ways to make biodiesel, direct use and blending, microemulsions, thermal cracking (pyrolysis) and transesterification. The most commonly used method is transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats. The transesterification reaction is affected by molar ratio of glycerides to alcohol, catalysts, reaction temperature, reaction time and free fatty acids and water content of oils or fats. The mechanism and kinetics of the transesterification show how the reaction occurs and progresses. The processes of transesterification and its downstream operations are also addressed.},

	abstract = {A renewable source of energy is a pressing global need. The biological conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels by microorganisms presents a promising avenue, but few organisms have been studied thoroughly enough to develop the genetic tools necessary for rigorous experimentation. The filamentous-fungal endophyte A. sarcoides produces metabolites when grown on a cellulose-based medium that include eight-carbon volatile organic compounds, which are potential biofuel targets. Here we use broadly applicable methods including genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to explore the biofuel production of A. sarcoides. These data were used to assemble the genome into 16 scaffolds, to thoroughly annotate the cellulose-degradation machinery, and to make predictions for the production pathway for the eight-carbon volatiles. Extremely high expression of the gene swollenin when grown on cellulose highlights the importance of accessory proteins in addition to the enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of the polymers. Correlation of the production of the eight-carbon biofuel-like metabolites with the expression of lipoxygenase pathway genes suggests the catabolism of linoleic acid as the mechanism of eight-carbon compound production. This is the first fungal genome to be sequenced in the family Helotiaceae, and A. sarcoides was isolated as an endophyte, making this work also potentially useful in fungal systematics and the study of plant–fungus relationships.},

However, the development of effective and easy-to-use methods for identifying such conserved gene clusters among multiple genomes-synteny blocks-as well as databases, which host synteny blocks from various groups of species (especially eukaryotes) and also allow users to run synteny-identification programs, lags behind.{DESCRIPTIONS}:{OrthoClusterDB} is a new online platform for the identification and visualization of synteny blocks. {OrthoClusterDB} consists of two key web pages: Run {OrthoCluster} and View Synteny. The Run {OrthoCluster} page serves as web front-end to {OrthoCluster}, a recently developed program for synteny block detection. Run {OrthoCluster} offers full control over the functionalities of {OrthoCluster}, such as specifying synteny block size, considering order and strandedness of genes within synteny blocks, including or excluding nested synteny blocks, handling one-to-many orthologous relationships, and comparing multiple genomes. In contrast, the View Synteny page gives access to perfect and imperfect synteny blocks precomputed for a large number of genomes, without the need for users to retrieve and format input data. Additionally, genes are cross-linked with public databases for effective browsing.

High-titer microbial synthesis of limonene and α-bisabolene could pave the way for advances in in vivo engineering of tailor-made hydrocarbons, and production at commercial scale. We have engineered the fast-growing unicellular euryhaline cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. {PCC} 7002 to produce yields of 4 mg L−1 limonene and 0.6 mg L−1 α-bisabolene through heterologous expression of the Mentha spicata
l-limonene synthase or the Abies grandis (E)-α-bisabolene synthase genes, respectively. Titers were significantly higher when a dodecane overlay was applied during culturing, suggesting either that dodecane traps large quantities of volatile limonene or α-bisabolene that would otherwise be lost to evaporation, and/or that continuous product removal in dodecane alleviates product feedback inhibition to promote higher rates of synthesis. We also investigate limonene and bisabolene production in the Δ{glgC} genetic background, where carbon partitioning is redirected at the expense of glycogen biosynthesis. The Synechococcus sp. {PCC} 7002 Δ{glgC} mutant excreted a suite of overflow metabolites (α-ketoisocaproate, pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and acetate) during nitrogen-deprivation, and also at the onset of stationary growth in nutrient-replete media. None of the excreted metabolites, however, appeared to be effectively utilized for terpenoid metabolism. Interestingly, we observed a 1.6- to 2.5-fold increase in the extracellular concentration of most excreted organic acids when the Δ{glgC} mutant was conferred with the ability to produce limonene. Overall, Synechococcus sp. {PCC} 7002 provides a highly promising platform for terpenoid biosynthetic and metabolic engineering efforts.},

This is in continuation of our earlier work where a direct method was developed for the determination of naphthenes and aromatics content in straight run gasoline (no olefins). The total naphthenes have been estimated by applying the overlapping factor (F) due to the overlapping of signals of olefinic hydrocarbons with those of saturated cyclic hydrocarbons in the region of 1.4-2.0 ppm in the 1H {NMR} spectrum. The application of F eliminates contribution of substituted olefinic protons in the naphthenic region and allow measurement of integral area exclusively due to naphthenic protons. The estimation of absolute number of olefinic hydrogens (H) or carbons (Co) in the olefinic region (4.5-6.6 ppm) together with the estimation of average alkyl chain length (n) of gasoline samples have facilitated the determination of total olefin content in the sample. The overlapping factor is different for {FCC} and coker gasoline due to the presence of different types of olefinic structures and their relative distribution. The utilisation of these parameters (F, n, H and Co), and average group molecular weight concept have helped the derivation of equation enabling the direct estimation of {PONA} content of a sample.

Its conidia production is prolific, and so human respiratory tract exposure is almost constant. A. fumigatus is isolated from human habitats and vegetable compost heaps. In immunocompromised individuals, the incidence of invasive infection can be as high as 50\% and the mortality rate is often about 50\% (ref. 2). The interaction of A. fumigatus and other airborne fungi with the immune system is increasingly linked to severe asthma and sinusitis. Although the burden of invasive disease caused by A. fumigatus is substantial, the basic biology of the organism is mostly obscure. Here we show the complete 29.4-megabase genome sequence of the clinical isolate Af293, which consists of eight chromosomes containing 9,926 predicted genes. Microarray analysis revealed temperature-dependent expression of distinct sets of genes, as well as 700 A. fumigatus genes not present or significantly diverged in the closely related sexual species Neosartorya fischeri, many of which may have roles in the pathogenicity phenotype. The Af293 genome sequence provides an unparalleled resource for the future understanding of this remarkable fungus.},

To this end, {cDNA}-{AFLP} analysis of enriched {mRNA} revealed that two healthy subjects showed highly divergent expression profiles with considerable fluctuations in time. Subsequent excision and sequence determination of bands from the {mRNA}-enriched profiles resulted in 122 identifiable sequences (transcripts and {rRNAs}). The classification of retrieved transcripts into functional clusters based on {COG} (cluster of orthologous genes) annotation showed that most assigned transcripts belonged to the metabolism cluster (26\% of all sequences), underlining that even at the very end of the intestinal tract the microbiota is still very active.

Several popular ‘omics’ platforms that have been used in microbial systems biology include transcriptomics, which measures {mRNA} transcript levels; proteomics, which quantifies protein abundance; metabolomics, which determines abundance of small cellular metabolites; interactomics, which resolves the whole set of molecular interactions in cells; and fluxomics, which establishes dynamic changes of molecules within a cell over time. However, no single ‘omics’ analysis can fully unravel the complexities of fundamental microbial biology. Therefore, integration of multiple layers of information, the multi-‘omics’ approach, is required to acquire a precise picture of living micro-organisms. In spite of this being a challenging task, some attempts have been made recently to integrate heterogeneous ‘omics’ datasets in various microbial systems and the results have demonstrated that the multi-‘omics’ approach is a powerful tool for understanding the functional principles and dynamics of total cellular systems. This article reviews some basic concepts of various experimental ‘omics’ approaches, recent application of the integrated ‘omics’ for exploring metabolic and regulatory mechanisms in microbes, and advances in computational and statistical methodologies associated with integrated ‘omics’ analyses.

Terpenes, which are typical components of the essential oils of flowers and fruits, are also present as free and glycosylated conjugates amongst the secondary metabolites of certain wine grape varieties of Vitis vinifera. Hence, when these compounds are present in wine they are considered to originate from grape and not fermentation. However, the biosynthesis of monoterpenes by S. cerevisiae in the absence of grape derived precursors is shown here to be of de novo origin in wine yeast strains. Higher concentration of assimilable nitrogen increased accumulation of linalool and citronellol. Microaerobic compared with anaerobic conditions favored terpene accumulation in the ferment. The amount of linalool produced by some strains of S. cerevisiae could be of sensory importance in wine production. These unexpected results are discussed in relation to the known sterol biosynthetic pathway and to an alternative pathway for terpene biosynthesis not previously described in yeast.},

	abstract = {A molecular understanding of volatile anesthetic mechanisms of action will require structural descriptions of anesthetic-protein complexes. Previous work has demonstrated that the halogenated alkane volatile anesthetics halothane and chloroform bind to the hydrophobic core of the four-\{alpha\}-helix bundle (A\{alpha\}2-L38M)2 (Johansson et al., 2000, 2003). This study shows that the halogenated ether anesthetics isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane are also bound to the hydrophobic core of the four-\{alpha\}-helix bundle, using isothermal titration calorimetry. Isoflurane and sevoflurane both bound to the four-\{alpha\}-helix bundle with Kd values of 140 \{+/-\} 10 \{micro\}M, whereas enflurane bound with a Kd value of 240 \{+/-\} 10 \{micro\}M. The \{Delta\}H\{degrees\} values associated with isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane binding were -7.7 \{+/-\} 0.1 kcal/mol, -8.2 \{+/-\} 0.2 kcal/mol, and -7.2 \{+/-\} 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The \{Delta\}S\{degrees\} values accompanying isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane binding were -8.5 cal/mol K, -10.4 cal/mol K, and -8.0 cal/mol K, respectively. The results indicate that the hydrophobic core of (A\{alpha\}2-L38M)2 is able to accommodate three modern ether anesthetics with Kd values that approximate their clinical {EC}50 values. The \{Delta\}H\{degrees\} values point to the importance of polar interactions for volatile general anesthetic binding, and suggest that hydrogen bonding to the ether oxygens may be operative.},

Inguinal hernia repair is the most common procedure in general surgery, thus improvements in surgical techniques, which reduce the burden of undesirable postoperative outcomes, are of clinical importance.


{METHODS}

A randomized, controlled, patient- and evaluator-blinded study (Tissucol/Tisseel for {MEsh} fixation in {LIchtenstein} hernia repair [{TIMELI}]; trial {NCT}00306839) was conducted among patients eligible for Lichtenstein repair of uncomplicated unilateral primary inguinal small-medium sized hernia. Patients were subject to mesh fixation with either fibrin sealant or sutures. Main outcome measures were visual analogue scale ({VAS}) assessments for "pain," "numbness," and "groin discomfort" on a scale of 0 = best and 100 = worst outcome. The primary endpoint was a composite that evaluated the prevalence of chronic disabling complications ({VAS} score {\textgreater}30 for pain/numbness/groin discomfort) at 12 months after surgery.


{RESULTS}

In total, 319 patients were randomized between January 2006 and April 2007 (159 fibrin sealant, 160 sutures). At 12 months, the prevalence of 1 or more disabling complication was significantly lower in the fibrin sealant group than in the sutures group (8.1\% vs 14.8\%; P = 0.0344). Less pain was reported in the fibrin sealant group than in the sutures group at 1 and 6 months (P = 0.0132; P = 0.0052), as reflected by a lower proportion of patients using analgesics in the fibrin group over the study duration (65.2\% vs 79.7\%; P = 0.0009). Only 3 of 316 patients (0.9\%) experienced recurrence. The incidences of wound-healing complications and other adverse events were comparable between groups.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Fibrin sealant for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein repair of small-medium sized inguinal hernias is well tolerated and reduces the rate of pain/numbness/groin discomfort by 45\% relative to sutures without increasing hernia recurrence ({NCT}00306839).},

	abstract = {Massarina ingoldiana occurs worldwide on a variety of dead plant substrates in aquatic habitats. This species has been accommodated in Massarina or Lophiostoma in Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes, but the validity of either of these taxonomic placements has not been confirmed with molecular data. In addition morphological variations occur among different populations of this species causing problems in identification. To evaluate the generic placement and monophyly of M. ingoldiana and the taxonomic usefulness of variable morphological features, phylo-genetic analyses based on {SSU} and {LSU} sequences of ribosomal {DNA} were conducted for 10 putative strains of this species and its relatives. Phylogenies revealed that M. ingoldiana sensu lato is polyphyletic and comprises two distinct lineages within Pleosporales. Neither lineage was congeneric with either Massarina or Lophiostoma. Based on molecular data and a reevaluation of morphology, two new genera, Lindgomyces and Tingoldiago, are established for the two lineages of M. ingoldiana sensu lato. Lindgomyces includes four species, L. ingoldianus comb. nov. (= M. ingoldiana sensu stricto), L. rotundatus sp. nov. (= M. ingoldiana sensu lato), L. cinctosporae sp. nov. and L. breviappendiculatus comb. nov. (= Lophiostoma breviappendiculatum). A new aquatic family, Lindgomycetaceae, is proposed for Lindgomyces and its sister taxon, Massariosphaeria typhicola. Isolates of a fungus from submerged Phragmites, with ascospores similar to those of M. ingoldiana, occurred in an additional single species lineage distant from that of M. ingoldiana (Lindgomyces). This fungus is described as Tingoldiago graminicola gen. \& sp. nov. The discovery that Tingoldiago, which occurs in a lineage distantly related to Lindgomyces but has morphologically similar ascospores and ascospore sheaths, suggests that the elaborate ascospore sheath in M. ingoldiana has arisen in two separate lineages as a result of convergent evolution in response to the aquatic environment. The large gelatinous sheath previously was considered one of the most distinctive and stable features for species identification of M. ingoldiana.},

These esters are responsible for fruity flavours that can be regarded either as a defect or as an attribute by the consumer. An understanding of the mechanisms of ester biosynthesis will enable control of the development of fruity flavours in fermented dairy products. The biosynthesis of flavour-active esters in dairy systems proceeds through two enzymatic mechanisms—esterification and alcoholysis. Esterification is the formation of esters from alcohols and carboxylic acids, whereas alcoholysis is the production of esters from alcohols and acylglycerols or from alcohols and fatty acyl-{CoAs} derived from metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids and/or carbohydrates. Alcoholysis is essentially a transferase reaction in which fatty acyl groups from acylglycerols and acyl-{CoA} derivatives are directly transferred to alcohols and is the major mechanism of ester biosynthesis by dairy lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.},

Previously, two membrane-embedded acidic residues, Asp142 and Glu327, have been reported to be important for multidrug transport activity of {LmrP}. Here we show that neither Glu327 nor Asp142 is essential for ethidium binding but that Glu327 is a critical residue for the high affinity binding of Hoechst 33342. Substitution of these two residues, however, negatively influences the transport activity. The energetics of transport was studied of two closely related cationic substrates ethidium and propidium that carry one and two positive charges, respectively. Extrusion of monovalent ethidium is dependent on both the electrical membrane potential (Deltapsi) and transmembrane proton gradient ({DeltapH}), while extrusion of propidium predominantly depends on the {DeltapH} only. The {LmrP} mutants D142C and E327C, however, mediate electroneutral ethidium extrusion, but are unable to mediate {DeltapH}-dependent extrusion of propidium. These data indicate that Asp142 and Glu327 are involved in proton translocation.},

Various efforts have been made to transfer the clostridial 1-butanol pathway into other microorganisms. However, in contrast to similar compounds, only limited titers of 1-butanol were attained. In this work, we constructed a modified clostridial 1-butanol pathway in Escherichia coli to provide an irreversible reaction catalyzed by trans-enoyl-coenzyme A ({CoA}) reductase (Ter) and created {NADH} and acetyl-{CoA} driving forces to direct the flux. We achieved high-titer (30 g/liter) and high-yield (70 to 88\% of the theoretical) production of 1-butanol anaerobically, comparable to or exceeding the levels demonstrated by native producers. Without the {NADH} and acetyl-{CoA} driving forces, the Ter reaction alone only achieved about 1/10 the level of production. The engineered host platform also enables the selection of essential enzymes with better catalytic efficiency or expression by anaerobic growth rescue. These results demonstrate the importance of driving forces in the efficient production of nonnative products.},

	abstract = {Aspergillus nidulans produces two major siderophores: it excretes triacetylfusarinine C to capture iron and contains ferricrocin as an intracellular iron-storage compound. Siderophore biosynthesis involves the enzymatic activity of nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPS}). {NRPS} contain 4'-phosphopantetheine as an essential prosthetic group, which is attached by 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases. A. nidulans appears to possess at least one gene, {npgA}, encoding such an enzyme. Using a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive allele, {cfwA}2, we showed that {NpgA} is essential for biosynthesis of both the peptide bond-containing ferricrocin and the ester bond-containing triacetylfusarinene C. The {cfwA}2 strain was found to be iron-starved at the restrictive temperature during iron-replete conditions, consistent with the siderophore system being the major iron-uptake system-as we recently demonstrated. Northern analysis indicated that, in contrast to other genes which are involved in siderophore biosynthesis and uptake, expression of {npgA} is not controlled by the {GATA}-transcription factor {SreA}. It was shown previously that {NpgA} is required for biosynthesis of penicillin, pigment, and potentially lysine via the alpha-aminoadipate pathway. Supplementation with lysine plus triacetylfusarinine C restored normal growth of the {cfwA}2 strain at the restrictive temperature, suggesting that the growth defect of the mutant is mainly due to impaired biosynthesis of siderophores and lysine.},

Phylogenetic analysis of the isolate using five loci suggests that it is closely related to Nigrograna mackinnonii {CBS} 674.75. The main component of the polyene series was purified and identified as (3E,5E,7E)-nona-1,3,5,7-tetraene ({NTE}), a novel natural product. Non-oxygenated hydrocarbons of this chain length are uncommon and desirable as gasoline-surrogate biofuels. The biosynthetic pathway for {NTE} production was explored using metabolic labeling and gas chromatography time of flight mass spectometer ({GCMS}). Two-carbon incorporation (13)C acetate suggests that it is derived from a polyketide synthase ({PKS}) followed by decarboxylation. There are several known mechanisms for such decarboxylation, though none have been discovered in fungi. Towards identifying the {PKS} responsible for the production of {NTE}, the genome of N. mackinnonii E5202H ({ATCC} {SD}-6839) was sequenced and assembled. Of the 32 {PKSs} present in the genome, 17 are predicted to contain sufficient domains for the production of {NTE}.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACTThe} smallest membrane protein shown to catalyze ion-coupled transport is documented in this report. A gene coding for a small 110-amino acid membrane protein ({emrE} or {mvrC}) has been previously identified and cloned and shown to render Escherichia coli cells resistant to methyl viologen and to ethidium. In this report, it is shown that the resistance is due to extrusion of the toxic compounds in a process that requires a proton electrochemical gradient rather than {ATP}. For this purpose, cells in which the unc gene was inactivated were used so that the interconversion between the proton gradient and {ATP} is not possible, and the effect of agents, which specifically affect either of them, was tested on transport of ethidium in the intact cell. In addition, {EmrE} has been overexpressed and metabolically labeled with [[{IMG}]\_3083\_tex2html\_wrap945.gif"{\textgreater}S]methionine. Strikingly, the protein can be quantitatively extracted with a mixture of organic solvents such as chloroform:methanol and is practically pure after this extraction. Moreover, after addition of E. coli lipids to the chloroform:methanol extract, {EmrE} has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes loaded with ammonium chloride. Upon dilution of the proteoliposomes in ammonium-free medium, a {pH} gradient was formed that drove transport of ethidium and methyl viologen into the proteoliposome. Both substrates compete with each other and exchange with previously transported solute. {EmrE} is a multidrug transporter of a novel type, and, because of its size and its solubility properties, it provides a unique model to study structure-function aspects of transport reactions in ion-coupled processes.},

	abstract = {Sequence data arising from an increasing number of partial and complete genome projects is revealing the presence of the polyketide synthase ({PKS}) family of genes not only in microbes and fungi but also in plants and other eukaryotes. {PKSs} are huge multifunctional megasynthases that use a variety of biosynthetic paradigms to generate enormously diverse arrays of polyketide products that posses several pharmaceutically important properties. The remarkable conservation of these gene clusters across organisms offers abundant scope for obtaining novel insights into {PKS} biosynthetic code by computational analysis. We have carried out a comprehensive in silico analysis of modular and iterative gene clusters to test whether chemical structures of the secondary metabolites can be predicted from {PKS} protein sequences. Here, we report the success of our method and demonstrate the feasibility of deciphering the putative metabolic products of uncharacterized {PKS} clusters found in newly sequenced genomes. Profile Hidden Markov Model analysis has revealed distinct sequence features that can distinguish modular {PKS} proteins from their iterative counterparts. For iterative {PKS} proteins, structural models of iterative ketosynthase ({KS}) domains have revealed novel correlations between the size of the polyketide products and volume of the active site pocket. Furthermore, we have identified key residues in the substrate binding pocket that control the number of chain extensions in iterative {PKSs}. For modular {PKS} proteins, we describe for the first time an automated method based on crucial intermolecular contacts that can distinguish the correct biosynthetic order of substrate channeling from a large number of non-cognate combinatorial possibilities. Taken together, our in silico analysis provides valuable clues for formulating rules for predicting polyketide products of iterative as well as modular {PKS} clusters. These results have promising potential for discovery of novel natural products by genome mining and rational design of novel natural products.

Polyketide synthases ({PKSs}) form a large family of multifunctional proteins involved in the biosynthesis of diverse classes of therapeutically important natural products. These enzymes biosynthesize natural products with enormous diversity in chemical structures by combinatorial use of a limited number of catalytic domains. Therefore, deciphering the rules for relating the amino acid sequence of these domains to the chemical structure of the polyketide product remains a major challenge. We have carried out bioinformatics analysis of a large number of {PKS} clusters with known metabolic products to correlate the chemical structures of these metabolites to the sequence and structural features of the {PKS} proteins. The remarkable conservation observed in the {PKS} sequences across organisms, combined with unique structural features in their active sites and contact surfaces, allowed us to formulate a comprehensive set of predictive rules for deciphering metabolic products of uncharacterized {PKS} clusters. Our work thus represents a major milestone in natural product research, demonstrating the feasibility of discovering novel metabolites by in silico genome mining. These results also have interesting implications for rational design of novel natural products using a biosynthetic engineering approach.},

However, the complex structure of metabolism has meant that a compete understanding of which pathways are required to produce an observed metabolic response is not fully understood. In this article, we propose an approach that can identify the genetic pathways which dictate the response of metabolic network to specific experimental conditions.Results: Our approach is a combination of probabilistic models for pathway ranking, clustering and classification. First, we use a non-parametric pathway extraction method to identify the most highly correlated paths through the metabolic network. We then extract the defining structure within these top-ranked pathways using both Markov clustering and classification algorithms. Furthermore, we define detailed node and edge annotations, which enable us to track each pathway, not only with respect to its genetic dependencies, but also allow for an analysis of the interacting reactions, compounds and {KEGG} sub-networks. We show that our approach identifies biologically meaningful pathways within two microarray expression datasets using entire {KEGG} metabolic networks.Availability and implementation: An R package containing a full implementation of our proposed method is currently available from http://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/{timhancockContact}: timhancock@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.{jpSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, cycle tracks (physically separated bicycle-exclusive paths along roads, as found in The Netherlands) are discouraged in the {USA} by engineering guidance that suggests that facilities such as cycle tracks are more dangerous than the street. The objective of this study conducted in Montreal (with a longstanding network of cycle tracks) was to compare bicyclist injury rates on cycle tracks versus in the street. For six cycle tracks and comparable reference streets, vehicle/bicycle crashes and health record injury counts were obtained and use counts conducted. The relative risk ({RR}) of injury on cycle tracks, compared with reference streets, was determined. Overall, 2.5 times as many cyclists rode on cycle tracks compared with reference streets and there were 8.5 injuries and 10.5 crashes per million bicycle-kilometres. The {RR} of injury on cycle tracks was 0.72 (95\% {CI} 0.60 to 0.85) compared with bicycling in reference streets. These data suggest that the injury risk of bicycling on cycle tracks is less than bicycling in streets. The construction of cycle tracks should not be discouraged.},

The resulting classification depends on the reference sequences and taxonomic hierarchy used to train the model; although the influence of primer sets and classification algorithms have been explored in detail, the influence of training set has not been characterized. We compared classification results obtained using three different publicly available databases as training sets, applied to five different bacterial 16S {rRNA} gene pyrosequencing data sets generated (from human body, mouse gut, python gut, soil and anaerobic digester samples). We observed numerous advantages to using the largest, most diverse training set available, that we constructed from the Greengenes ({GG}) bacterial/archaeal 16S {rRNA} gene sequence database and the latest {GG} taxonomy. Phylogenetic clusters of previously unclassified experimental sequences were identified with notable improvements (for example, 50\% reduction in reads unclassified at the phylum level in mouse gut, soil and anaerobic digester samples), especially for phylotypes belonging to specific phyla (Tenericutes, Chloroflexi, Synergistetes and Candidate phyla {TM}6, {TM}7). Trimming the reference sequences to the primer region resulted in systematic improvements in classification depth, and greatest gains at higher confidence thresholds. Phylotypes unclassified at the genus level represented a greater proportion of the total community variation than classified operational taxonomic units in mouse gut and anaerobic digester samples, underscoring the need for greater diversity in existing reference databases.},

The gene coding for the bacterial multidrug transporter, like the P-glycoprotein gene in mammalian {MDR} cells, was amplified in the resistant bacteria. On the other hand, the bacterial multidrug transporter showed no sequence similarity to P-glycoprotein but exhibited an obvious homology to tetracycline efflux pumps and carbohydrate-ion symporters.

	shorttitle = {Efficiency and safety of mesh fixation in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair using n-butyl cyanoacrylate},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

In adult patients, most inguinal hernias are treated by implanting a prosthetic mesh. To prevent mesh dislocation and thus recurrence, different types of fixation have been proposed. In contrast to penetrating fixation known to cause acute chronic pain, adhesive fixation is becoming increasingly popular as it reduces markedly the risk of injury and chronic pain. Apart from the biological sealants (e.g., fibrin glue), surgical adhesives include a group of synthetic glues and genetically engineered protein glues. For example, cyanoacrylate is used in various medical and veterinary indications due to its fast action, excellent bonding strength and low price.


{OBJECTIVE}

The main objective of this paper was to communicate positive results obtained using n-butyl-cyanoacrylate glue to fix prosthetic meshes in over 1,300 {TAPP} repairs of primary and recurrent inguinal hernias. The secondary objective was to highlight the rationale (e.g., safety) for using non-fibrin based glue in this type of procedure.


{METHOD}

We present the in vitro and in vivo data necessary for the approval of n-butyl cyanoacrylate Histoacryl(®) glue. We use an equivalent glue, Glubran-2(®), to fix prosthetic meshes in 1,336 laparoscopic {TAPP} repairs.


{RESULTS}

Standardized tests to detect sensitization, irritation, genotoxicity or systemic toxicity demonstrated the safety and biocompatibility of Histoacryl(®), which met all requirements, including those of {ISO} 10993. Histological long-term studies in rabbits yielded results comparable to routine suture fixations, with full integration of the mesh into the abdominal wall. The clinical results showed the following advantages: fast application of the glue, reduced postoperative pain, 0.0\% infection rate, continuously low recurrence rate and shorter hospital stay. No adverse effects and no complaints were recorded.


{CONCLUSION}

The experimental and clinical data demonstrate the safe use and the excellent cost-benefit ratio of n-butyl cyanoacrylate compared with other techniques of mesh fixation.},

In the last two decades, culture-independent approaches have provided new insights into their structure and function, with the exponentially decreasing cost of high-throughput sequencing resulting in broadly available tools for microbial surveys. However, the field remains far from reaching a technological plateau, as both computational techniques and nucleotide sequencing platforms for microbial genomic and transcriptional content continue to improve. Current microbiome analyses are thus starting to adopt multiple and complementary meta'omic approaches, leading to unprecedented opportunities to comprehensively and accurately characterize microbial communities and their interactions with their environments and hosts. This diversity of available assays, analysis methods, and public data is in turn beginning to enable microbiome-based predictive and modeling tools. We thus review here the technological and computational meta'omics approaches that are already available, those that are under active development, their success in biological discovery, and several outstanding challenges.},

In this chapter, approaches for observing the lateral diffusion of lipids using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching are described. The procedures described can be carried out with a standard laser-scanning confocal microscope. The membrane of interest is stained with a lipophilic fluorophore or fluorescent lipid analog. The confocal laser spot is then used to photobleach fluorescence in a small region of the sample. Subsequent spread and recovery of the bleach, reports on the diffusion of the fluorophore. The results provide a measure of membrane fluidity, and the extent to which lipid diffusion in the membrane might be constrained. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements may be carried out in vivo, in systems ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells, or in vitro in isolated membrane fragments. Procedures for preparing the biological sample, performing the measurement, and quantitative data analysis are explained.},

	abstract = {{EmrE} belongs to a family of eubacterial multidrug transporters that confer resistance to a wide variety of toxins by coupling the influx of protons to toxin extrusion. {EmrE} was purified and crystallized in two dimensions by reconstitution with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine into lipid bilayers. Images of frozen hydrated crystals were collected by cryo-electron microscopy and a projection structure of {EmrE} was calculated to 7\&nbsp;\&\#x0212b; resolution. The projection map shows an asymmetric {EmrE} dimer with overall dimensions {\textasciitilde}31 \&\#x000d7; 40 \&\#x0212b;, comprising an arc of highly tilted helices separating two helices nearly perpendicular to the membrane from another two helices, one tilted and the other nearly perpendicular. There is no obvious 2-fold symmetry axis perpendicular to the membrane within the dimer, suggesting that the monomers may have different structures in the functional unit.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to uncover the biosynthetic potential of plant-associated fungi, the effect of culture conditions on metabolite production by Paraphaeosphaeria quadriseptata and Chaetomium chiversii was investigated. These studies indicated that the production of the major metabolites by P. quadriseptata differ when the water used to make the media was changed from tap water to distilled water. It resulted in the isolation of six new secondary metabolites, cytosporones F?I (1?4), quadriseptin A (5), and 5?-hydroxymonocillin {III} (6) together with monocillin {III} (7), a metabolite new to P. quadriseptata, in addition to monocillin I (8), a previously known metabolite from this organism. Aposphaerin B (9) encountered was suspected to be an artifact originating from cytosporone F (1). Incorporation of heavy metal ions to P. quadriseptata culture medium induced production of monocillin I (8) by this fungus. Cultivation of C. chiversii in liquid medium resulted in the isolation of chaetochromin A (12) as the major metabolite instead of radicicol (10), the major constituent of this organism when grown in a solid medium. Compounds 1?7 and 12 were evaluated for their potential to inhibit Hsp90 and antiproliferative activity toward the cancer cell lines {NCI}-H460, {MCF}-7, and {SF}-268.

	abstract = {Monoterpenes can, upon hydrogenation, be used as light-fraction components of sustainable aviation fuels. Fermentative production of monoterpenes in engineered microorganisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has gained attention as a potential route to deliver these next-generation fuels from renewable biomass. However, end product toxicity presents a formidable problem for microbial synthesis. Due to their hydrophobicity, monoterpene inhibition has long been attributed to membrane interference, but the molecular mechanism remains largely unsolved. In order to gain a better understanding of the mode of action, we analyzed the composition and structural integrity of the cell envelope as well as the transcriptional response of yeast cells treated with an inhibitory amount of d-limonene (107 mg/liter). We found no alterations in membrane fluidity, structural membrane integrity, or fatty acid composition after the solvent challenge. A 4-fold increase in the mean fluorescence intensity per cell (using calcofluor white stain) and increased sensitivity to cell wall-degrading enzymes demonstrated that limonene disrupts cell wall properties. Global transcript measurements confirmed the membrane integrity observations by showing no upregulation of ergosterol or fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, which are commonly overexpressed in yeast to reinforce membrane rigidity during ethanol exposure. Limonene shock did cause a compensatory response to cell wall damage through overexpression of several genes ({ROM}1, {RLM}1, {PIR}3, {CTT}1, {YGP}1, {MLP}1, {PST}1, and {CWP}1) involved with the cell wall integrity signaling pathway. This is the first report demonstrating that cell wall, rather than plasma membrane, deterioration is the main source of monoterpene inhibition. We show that limonene can alter the structure and function of the cell wall, which has a clear effect on cytokinesis.},

However, due to the lack of steady-state kinetic information and incomplete understanding of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, it has been difficult to build a highly efficient, universal system. Here, we reconstituted the mevalonate pathway to produce farnesene (a precursor of new jet fuel) in vitro using purified protein components. The information from this in vitro reconstituted system guided us to rationally optimize farnesene production in E. coli by quantitatively overexpressing each component. Targeted proteomic assays and intermediate assays were used to determine the metabolic status of each mutant. Through targeted engineering, farnesene production could be increased predictably step by step, up to 1.1 g/L (∼2,000 fold) 96 h after induction at the shake-flask scale. The strategy developed to release the potential of the mevalonate pathway for terpenoid overproduction should also work in other multistep synthetic pathways. Biotechnol.

We evaluated soil fungal diversity at two sites in a temperate forest using direct isolation of small-subunit and internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) {rRNA} genes by {PCR} and high-throughput sequencing of cloned fragments. We identified 412 sequence types from 863 fungal {ITS} sequences, as well as 112 {ITS} sequences from other eukaryotic microorganisms. Equal proportions of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota sequences were present in both the {ITS} and small-subunit libraries, while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower frequencies. Many sequences closely matched sequences from mycorrhizal, plant-pathogenic, and saprophytic fungi. Compositional differences were observed among samples from different soil depths, with mycorrhizal species predominating deeper in the soil profile and saprophytic species predominating in the litter layer. Richness was consistently lowest in the deepest soil horizon samples. Comparable levels of fungal richness have been observed following traditional specimen-based collecting and culturing surveys, but only after much more extensive sampling. The high rate at which new sequence types were recovered even after sampling 863 fungal {ITS} sequences and the dominance of fungi in our libraries relative to other eukaryotes suggest that the abundance and diversity of fungi in forest soils may be much higher than previously hypothesized.},

Fungal chromosomes are at the lowest resolution of light microscopy; thus few attempts to visualise fungal chromosomes have been successful. Fungi examined have been mainly Ascomycotina. The number of chromosomes per nucleus, estimated by conventional light visualisation and stained with standard dyes like Giemsa or aceto-orceine, usually does not exceed ten. A method developed in the late 1980s called 'germ tube burst' enables the discharge of condensed chromosomes from the hyphal cell and their spread on the surface of a slide. This more accurate method, usually gives better resolution of chromosomes. It was used with conventional light microscopy dyes as well as in fluorescent microscopy or for in situ hybridisation. A breakthrough has been made in fungal genetics by using pulse field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE}). Separation of the chromosomes on the gel enables the determination of their number and estimation of genome size. It also reveals chromosome length polymorphism and the presence of supernumerary chromosomes, which are usually too small to visualise in nuclei. A combination of two methods, cytological analysis by light microscopy and {PFGE}, should give a tool allowing the complex analysis of fungal genomes.},

	abstract = {Negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To be a viable alternative, a biofuel should provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits, be economically competitive, and be producible in large quantities without reducing food supplies. We use these criteria to evaluate, through life-cycle accounting, ethanol from corn grain and biodiesel from soybeans. Ethanol yields 25\% more energy than the energy invested in its production, whereas biodiesel yields 93\% more. Compared with ethanol, biodiesel releases just 1.0\%, 8.3\%, and 13\% of the agricultural nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticide pollutants, respectively, per net energy gain. Relative to the fossil fuels they displace, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 12\% by the production and combustion of ethanol and 41\% by biodiesel. Biodiesel also releases less air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol. These advantages of biodiesel over ethanol come from lower agricultural inputs and more efficient conversion of feedstocks to fuel. Neither biofuel can replace much petroleum without impacting food supplies. Even dedicating all U.S. corn and soybean production to biofuels would meet only 12\% of gasoline demand and 6\% of diesel demand. Until recent increases in petroleum prices, high production costs made biofuels unprofitable without subsidies. Biodiesel provides sufficient environmental advantages to merit subsidy. Transportation biofuels such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels.},

Animal herbivores and, in some cases, pathogenic microbes are poisoned by the mycotoxins produced by endophytes. @'Constitutive mutualism@' is the relatively faithful association, usually with grasses, of endophytes that infect host ovules and are propagated in host seed; substantial fungal biomass with probable high metabolic cost develops throughout the aerial parts of the host plant. @'Inducible mutualist@' endophytes are not involved with host seed and disseminate independently through air or in water. Infecting only vegetative parts of the host and remaining metabolically inactive for long periods with relatively little fungal biomass, inducible mutualists grow rapidly and produce toxins against herbivores when damaged host tissues provide new sites for infection.

	abstract = {The genus Aspergillus is ideally suited for the investigation of {RNA} silencing evolution because it includes species that have experienced a variety of {RNA} silencing gene changes. Our work on this subject begins here with the model species Aspergillus nidulans. Filamentous ascomycete fungi generally each encode two of the core {RNA} silencing proteins, Dicer and Argonaute, but A. nidulans appears to have lost one of each to gene truncation events. Although a role in growth, development, or {RNA} silencing was not detected for the truncated genes, they do produce spliced and poly(A)-tailed transcripts, suggesting that they may have an undetermined biological function. Population analysis demonstrates that the truncated genes are fixed at the species level and that their full-length orthologs in a closely related species are also unstable. With these gene truncation events, A. nidulans encodes only a single intact Dicer and Argonaute. Their deletion results in morphologically and reproductively normal strains that are incapable of experimental {RNA} silencing. Thus, our results suggest that the remaining A. nidulans {RNA} silencing genes have a "nonhousekeeping" function, such as defense against viruses and transposons.},

The in silico model successfully predicted metabolic fluxes during the acidogenic phase using classical flux balance analysis. Nonlinear programming was used to predict metabolic fluxes during the solventogenic phase. In addition, essential genes were predicted via single gene deletion studies. This genome-scale in silico metabolic model of C. acetobutylicum should be useful for genome-wide metabolic analysis as well as strain development for improving production of biochemicals, including butanol.},

	abstract = {Cdr1p, a multidrug transporter from a pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, confers resistance to several unrelated drugs including anti-Candida drugs. We demonstrate that Cdr1p can specifically transport human steroid hormones namely 03B2-estradiol and corticosterone. Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformant S-12, harbouring the {CDR}1 gene, accumulated about 3-fold less [3H]03B2-estradiol and about 2-fold less [3H]corticosterone than the non-transformed strain. When {CDR}1 was expressed in {AD} strain ({AD}-{CDR}1) which had seven {ATP} binding cassette ({ABC}) superfamily of putative transporter genes disrupted, the net accumulation of these hormones as compared to S-12 was significantly lower. Efflux of 03B2-estradiol and corticosterone was inhibited by a 100-fold higher (200 {nM}) concentration of 03B2-estradiol, corticosterone, ergosterol or dexamethasone, but progesterone which could not be transported by Cdr1p did not affect the efflux and thus accumulation. Interestingly, some of the drugs viz. cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, fluconazole and o-phenanthroline, to which {CDR}1 confers resistance, could also prevent efflux and enhance accumulation to some extent. In conclusion, we show that human steroid hormones could be the substrates for Cdr1p and the energy dependent transport mediated by it is specific for estradiol and corticosterone.},

Volatile metabolites produced by the cultures were collected on a porous polymer adsorbent by passing an airstream through the vessel. Volatile metabolites were collected between days 2 and 5 after inoculation. {CO}2 production was simultaneously measured, and after the cultivation period ergosterol contents and the numbers of {CFU} of the cultures were determined. Alcohols of low molecular weight and sesquiterpenes were the dominant compounds found. During growth on oat grain the production of 8-carbon alcohols and 3-methyl-1-butanol was higher and the production of terpenes was lower than during growth on agar substrates. The compositions of the volatile metabolites from oat grain were more similar to those from wheat grain, which was used as a substrate in a previous investigation, than to those produced on any of the agar substrates. Regarding the agar substrates, the production of terpenes was most pronounced on the artificial substrates (Czapek agar and Norkrans agar) whereas alcohol production was highest on substrates based on cereals. The production of volatile metabolites was highly correlated with the production of {CO}2 and moderately correlated with ergosterol contents, whereas no correlation with the numbers of {CFU} was found. Thus, the volatile metabolites formed and the ergosterol contents of fungal cultures should be good indicators of present and past fungal activity.},

The present study more fully defined the {OleABCD} protein families within the thiolase, alpha/beta-hydrolase, {AMP}-dependent ligase/synthase, and short-chain dehydrogenase superfamilies, respectively. Only 0.1 to 1\% of each superfamily represents likely Ole proteins. Sequence analysis based on structural alignments and gene context was used to identify highly likely ole genes. Selected microorganisms from the phyla Verucomicrobia, Planctomyces, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were tested experimentally and shown to produce long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons. However, different species from the same genera sometimes lack the ole genes and fail to produce olefinic hydrocarbons. Overall, only 1.9\% of 3,558 genomes analyzed showed clear evidence for containing ole genes. The type of olefins produced by different bacteria differed greatly with respect to the number of carbon-carbon double bonds. The greatest number of organisms surveyed biosynthesized a single long-chain olefin, 3,6,9,12,15,19,22,25,28-hentriacontanonaene, that contains nine double bonds. Xanthomonas campestris produced the greatest number of distinct olefin products, 15 compounds ranging in length from C(28) to C(31) and containing one to three double bonds. The type of long-chain product formed was shown to be dependent on the {oleA} gene in experiments with Shewanella oneidensis {MR}-1 ole gene deletion mutants containing native or heterologous {oleA} genes expressed in trans. A strain deleted in {oleABCD} and containing {oleA} in trans produced only ketones. Based on these observations, it was proposed that {OleA} catalyzes a nondecarboxylative thiolytic condensation of fatty acyl chains to generate a beta-ketoacyl intermediate that can decarboxylate spontaneously to generate ketones.},

In this study, we engineered E. coli to produce α-farnesene using a codon-optimized α-farnesene synthase and an exogenous {MVA} pathway. Codon optimization of α-farnesene synthase improved both the synthase expression and α-farnesene production. Augmentation of the metabolic flux for {FPP} synthesis conferred a 1.6- to 48.0-fold increase in α-farnesene production. An additional increase in α-farnesene production was achieved by the protein fusion of {FPP} synthase and α-farnesene synthase. The engineered E. coli strain was able to produce 380.0 mg/L of α-farnesene, which is an approximately 317-fold increase over the initial production of 1.2 mg/L.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, {microRNA} regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

However, results from different studies using pyrosequencing and traditional sequencing are often difficult to compare, because amplicons covering different regions of the {rRNA} might yield different conclusions. We used sequences from over 200 globally dispersed environments to test whether studies that used similar primers clustered together mistakenly, without regard to environment. We then tested whether primer choice affects sequence-based community analyses using {UniFrac}, our recently-developed method for comparing microbial communities. We performed three tests of primer effects. We tested whether different simulated amplicons generated the same {UniFrac} clustering results as near-full-length sequences for three recent large-scale studies of microbial communities in the mouse and human gut, and the Guerrero Negro microbial mat. We then repeated this analysis for short sequences (100-, 150-, 200- and 250-base reads) resembling those produced by pyrosequencing. The results show that sequencing effort is best focused on gathering more short sequences rather than fewer longer ones, provided that the primers are chosen wisely, and that community comparison methods such as {UniFrac} are surprisingly robust to variation in the region sequenced.},

	abstract = {{MdfA} is an Escherichia coli multidrug-resistance transporter. Cells expressing {MdfA} from a multicopy plasmid exhibit multidrug resistance against a diverse group of toxic compounds. In this article, we show that, in addition to its role in multidrug resistance, {MdfA} confers extreme alkaline {pH} resistance and allows the growth of transformed cells under conditions that are close to those used normally by alkaliphiles (up to {pH} 10) by maintaining a physiological internal {pH}. {MdfA}-deleted E. coli cells are sensitive even to mild alkaline conditions, and the wild-type phenotype is restored fully by {MdfA} expressed from a plasmid. This activity of {MdfA} requires Na(+) or K(+). Fluorescence studies with inverted membrane vesicles demonstrate that {MdfA} catalyzes Na(+)- or K(+)-dependent proton transport, and experiments with reconstituted proteoliposomes confirm that {MdfA} is solely responsible for this phenomenon. Studies with multidrug resistance-defective {MdfA} mutants and competitive transport assays suggest that these activities of {MdfA} are related. Together, the results demonstrate that a single protein has an unprecedented capacity to turn E. coli from an obligatory neutrophile into an alkalitolerant bacterium, and they suggest a previously uncharacterized physiological role for {MdfA} in {pH} homeostasis.},

Specific problems have been encountered during these studies which have prevented the commercialization of monoterpene biotransformation processes. The most important problems were the chemical instability of monoterpenes, the substrate and product toxicity and the presence of multiple transformation pathways in the microorganisms. Notwithstanding the encountered problems, the area of monoterpene biotransformation remains of great potential commercial interest to the food and perfume industry. The main advantages of the use of biotechnological methods for the production of flavours and fragrances are the fact that terpenoids produced in this way can be called natural and the fact that biocatalysts show, in general, a high regio- and stereoselectivity. Information regarding the enzyme systems involved in monoterpene biodegradation, except for the degradation of (+)- and (−)-camphor by Pseudomonas putida, is rather scarce. However, during the past decade new information has become available on the purification and description of several enzymes involved in other monoterpene degradation pathways. The genetic information encoding some of these enzymes has been cloned and sequenced. In the future, genetic engineering techniques may provide modified strains which can be used for the production of the desired product.},

Volatile metabolites produced by the cultures were collected on a porous polymer adsorbent by passing an airstream through the vessel. Volatile metabolites were collected between days 2 and 5 after inoculation. {CO}2 production was simultaneously measured, and after the cultivation period ergosterol contents and the numbers of {CFU} of the cultures were determined. Alcohols of low molecular weight and sesquiterpenes were the dominant compounds found. During growth on oat grain the production of 8-carbon alcohols and 3-methyl-1-butanol was higher and the production of terpenes was lower than during growth on agar substrates. The compositions of the volatile metabolites from oat grain were more similar to those from wheat grain, which was used as a substrate in a previous investigation, than to those produced on any of the agar substrates. Regarding the agar substrates, the production of terpenes was most pronounced on the artificial substrates (Czapek agar and Norkrans agar) whereas alcohol production was highest on substrates based on cereals. The production of volatile metabolites was highly correlated with the production of {CO}2 and moderately correlated with ergosterol contents, whereas no correlation with the numbers of {CFU} was found. Thus, the volatile metabolites formed and the ergosterol contents of fungal cultures should be good indicators of present and past fungal activity.},

	abstract = {(E, E, E)-Geranylgeraniol ({GGOH}) is a valuable starting material for perfumes and pharmaceutical products. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {GGOH} is synthesized from the end products of the mevalonate pathway through the sequential reactions of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (encoded by the {ERG}20 gene), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (the {BTS}1 gene), and some endogenous phosphatases. We demonstrated that overexpression of the diacylglycerol diphosphate phosphatase ({DPP}1) gene could promote {GGOH} production. We also found that overexpression of a {BTS}1-{DPP}1 fusion gene was more efficient for producing {GGOH} than coexpression of these genes separately. Overexpression of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase ({HMG}1) gene, which encodes the major rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, resulted in overproduction of squalene (191.9 mg liter(-1)) rather than {GGOH} (0.2 mg liter(-1)) in test tube cultures. Coexpression of the {BTS}1-{DPP}1 fusion gene along with the {HMG}1 gene partially redirected the metabolic flux from squalene to {GGOH}. Additional expression of a {BTS}1-{ERG}20 fusion gene resulted in an almost complete shift of the flux to {GGOH} production (228.8 mg liter(-1) {GGOH} and 6.5 mg liter(-1) squalene). Finally, we constructed a diploid prototrophic strain coexpressing the {HMG}1, {BTS}1-{DPP}1, and {BTS}1-{ERG}20 genes from multicopy integration vectors. This strain attained 3.31 g liter(-1) {GGOH} production in a 10-liter jar fermentor with gradual feeding of a mixed glucose and ethanol solution. The use of bifunctional fusion genes such as the {BTS}1-{DPP}1 and {ERG}20-{BTS}1 genes that code sequential enzymes in the metabolic pathway was an effective method for metabolic engineering.},

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}) describes the transmission of genetic material across species boundaries and is an important evolutionary phenomenon in the ancestry of many microbes. The role of {HGT} in plant evolutionary history is, however, largely unexplored. Here, we compare the genomes of six plant species with those of 159 prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and identify 1689 genes that show the highest similarity to corresponding genes from fungi. We constructed a phylogeny for all 1689 genes identified and all homolog groups available from the rice (Oryza sativa) genome (3177 gene families) and used these to define 14 candidate plant-fungi {HGT} events. Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of these 14 data sets, using methods that account for site rate heterogeneity, demonstrated support for nine {HGT} events, demonstrating an infrequent pattern of {HGT} between plants and fungi. Five {HGTs} were fungi-to-plant transfers and four were plant-to-fungi {HGTs}. None of the fungal-to-plant {HGTs} involved angiosperm recipients. These results alter the current view of organismal barriers to {HGT}, suggesting that phagotrophy, the consumption of a whole cell by another, is not necessarily a prerequisite for {HGT} between eukaryotes. Putative functional annotation of the {HGT} candidate genes suggests that two fungi-to-plant transfers have added phenotypes important for life in a soil environment. Our study suggests that genetic exchange between plants and fungi is exceedingly rare, particularly among the angiosperms, but has occurred during their evolutionary history and added important metabolic traits to plant lineages.},

The Integrative Human Microbiome Project ({iHMP}, http://hmp2.org), the second phase of the {NIH} Human Microbiome Project, will study these interactions by analyzing microbiome and host activities in longitudinal studies of disease-specific cohorts and by creating integrated data sets of microbiome and host functional properties. These data sets will serve as experimental test beds to evaluate new models, methods, and analyses on the interactions of host and microbiome. Here we describe the three models of microbiome-associated human conditions, on the dynamics of preterm birth, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 2 diabetes, and their underlying hypotheses, as well as the multi-omic data types to be collected, integrated, and distributed through public repositories as a community resource.},

In this study, leaves from two populations of Guarea guidonia trees (Meliaceae) in the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico, were screened for diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities. A total of 268 leaf fragments from 14 trees were surveyed. Thirty-eight morphospecies of endophytes were found. Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi were the most abundant taxa. Over 95 percent of the leaf pieces had endophytes. Communities had a few abundant species and many species with few individuals. The fungal community from the Guarea population in a forest preserve was more diverse than that from a disturbed area. Fungal communities were stratified according to height within a tree, but no differences were found between blade, petiolule, and rachis. The data suggest that the smaller and the more scattered the plant fragments sampled, the higher the probability of approaching real diversity values of endophytic fungal communities.},

Recently bacterial endosymbionts were documented in soilborne Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina and in at least one species each of mycorrhizal Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Here we show for the first time that phylogenetically diverse endohyphal bacteria occur in living hyphae of diverse foliar endophytes, including representatives of four classes of Ascomycota. We examined 414 isolates of endophytic fungi, isolated from photosynthetic tissues of six species of cupressaceous trees in five biogeographic provinces, for endohyphal bacteria using microscopy and molecular techniques. Viable bacteria were observed within living hyphae of endophytic Pezizomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes from all tree species and biotic regions surveyed. A focus on 29 fungus/bacterium associations revealed that bacterial and fungal phylogenies were incongruent with each other and with taxonomic relationships of host plants. Overall, eight families and 15 distinct genotypes of endohyphal bacteria were recovered; most were members of the Proteobacteria, but a small number of Bacillaceae also were found, including one that appears to occur as an endophyte of plants. Frequent loss of bacteria following subculturing suggests a facultative association. Our study recovered distinct lineages of endohyphal bacteria relative to previous studies, is the first to document their occurrence in foliar endophytes representing four of the most species-rich classes of fungi, and highlights for the first time their diversity and phylogenetic relationships with regard both to the endophytes they inhabit and the plants in which these endophyte-bacterium symbiota occur.},

	abstract = {Trichoderma species have been used widely as biocontrol agents for the suppression of soil-borne pathogens. However, some antagonistic mechanisms of Trichoderma are not well characterized. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were designed to characterize the importance of mycoparasitism, exoenzymes, and volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) by Trichoderma harzianum T-E5 for the control of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum ({FOC}). We further tested whether these mechanisms were inducible and upregulated in presence of {FOC}. The results were as follows: T-E5 heavily parasitized {FOC} by coiling and twisting the entire mycelium of the pathogen in dual cultures. T-E5 growing medium conditioned with deactivated {FOC} (T2) showed more proteins and higher cell wall-degrading enzyme activities than T1, suggesting that {FOC} could induce the upregulation of exoenzymes. The presence of deactivated {FOC} (T2') also resulted in the upregulation of {VOCs} that five and eight different types T-E5-derived {VOCs} were identified from T1' and T2', respectively. Further, the excreted {VOCs} in T2' showed significantly higher antifungal activities against {FOC} than T1'. In conclusion, mycoparasitism of T-E5 against {FOC} involved mycelium contact and the production of complex extracellular substances. Together, these data provide clues to help further clarify the interactions between these fungi.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Pfam is a general-purpose database of protein domain alignments and profile Hidden Markov Models ({HMMs}), which is very popular for the annotation of sequence data produced by genome sequencing projects. Pfam provides models that are often very general in terms of the taxa that they cover and it has previously been suggested that such general models may lack some of the specificity or selectivity that would be provided by kingdom-specific models.{RESULTS}:Here we present a general approach to create domain libraries of {HMMs} for sub-taxa of a kingdom. Taking fungal species as an example, we construct a domain library of {HMMs} (called Fungal Pfam or {FPfam}) using sequences from 30 genomes, consisting of 24 species from the ascomycetes group and two basidiomycetes, Ustilago maydis, a fungal pathogen of maize, and the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. In addition, we include the Microsporidion Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite, and two non-fungal species, the oomycetes Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum, both plant pathogens. We evaluate the performance in terms of coverage against the original 30 genomes used in training {FPfam} and against five more recently sequenced fungal genomes that can be considered as an independent test set. We show that kingdom-specific models such as {FPfam} can find instances of both novel and well characterized domains, increases overall coverage and detects more domains per sequence with typically higher bitscores than Pfam for the same domain families. An evaluation of the effect of changing E-values on the coverage shows that the performance of {FPfam} is consistent over the range of E-values applied.{CONCLUSION}:Kingdom-specific models are shown to provide improved coverage. However, as the models become more specific, some sequences found by Pfam may be missed by the models in {FPfam} and some of the families represented in the test set are not present in {FPfam}. Therefore, we recommend that both general and specific libraries are used together for annotation and we find that a significant improvement in coverage is achieved by using both Pfam and {FPfam}.},

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that within the Hypocreales, there are two major clusters containing multiple Acremonium species. One clade contains Acremonium sclerotigenum, the genus Emericellopsis, and the genus Geosmithia as prominent elements. The second clade contains the genera Gliomastixsensu stricto and Bionectria. In addition, there are numerous smaller clades plus two multi-species clades, one containing Acremonium strictum and the type species of the genus Sarocladium, and, as seen in the combined {SSU}/{LSU} analysis, one associated subclade containing Acremonium breve and related species plus Acremonium curvulum and related species. This sequence information allows the revision of three genera. Gliomastix is revived for five species, G. murorum, G. polychroma, G. tumulicola, G. roseogrisea, and G. masseei. Sarocladium is extended to include all members of the phylogenetically distinct A. strictum clade including the medically important A. kiliense and the protective maize endophyte A. zeae. Also included in Sarocladium are members of the phylogenetically delimited Acremonium bacillisporum clade, closely linked to the A. strictum clade. The genus Trichothecium is revised following the principles of unitary nomenclature based on the oldest valid anamorph or teleomorph name, and new combinations are made in Trichothecium for the tightly interrelated Acremonium crotocinigenum, Spicellum roseum, and teleomorph Leucosphaerinaindica. Outside the Hypocreales, numerous Acremonium-like species fall into the Plectosphaerellaceae, and A. atrogriseum falls into the Cephalothecaceae.},

Down-regulation of {ERG}9 by replacing its native promoter with the regulatable {MET}3 promoter, enhanced cubebol titers but simultaneous over-expression of {tHMG}1 and repression of {ERG}9 did not further improve cubebol production. Furtheremore, the concentrations of squalene and ergosterol were measured in the engineered strains. Unexpectedly, significant accumulation of squalene and restoring the ergosterol biosynthesis were observed in the {ERG}9 repressed strains transformed with the plasmids harboring cubebol synthase gene. This could be explained by a toxicity effect of cubebol, possibly resulting in higher transcription levels for the genes under control of {MET}3 promoter, which could lead to accumulation of squalene and ergosterol.},

Since these 2-keto acids are precursors of amino acids, we aimed to construct an isobutanol production platform in Corynebacterium glutamicum, a well-known amino-acid-producing microorganism. Analysis of this host's sensitivity to isobutanol toxicity revealed that C. glutamicum shows an increased tolerance to isobutanol relative to Escherichia coli. Overexpression of {alsS} of Bacillus subtilis, {ilvC} and {ilvD} of C. glutamicum, kivd of Lactococcus lactis, and a native alcohol dehydrogenase, {adhA}, led to the production of 2.6 g/L isobutanol and 0.4 g/L 3-methyl-1-butanol in 48 h. In addition, other higher chain alcohols such as 1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol were also detected as byproducts. Using longer-term batch cultures, isobutanol titers reached 4.0 g/L after 96 h with wild-type C. glutamicum as a host. Upon the inactivation of several genes to direct more carbon through the isobutanol pathway, we increased production by approximately 25\% to 4.9 g/L isobutanol in a pycldh background. These results show promise in engineering C. glutamicum for higher chain alcohol production using the 2-keto acid pathways.},

	abstract = {New {DNA} sequencing technologies can sequence up to one billion bases in a single day at low cost, putting large-scale sequencing within the reach of many scientists. Many researchers are forging ahead with projects to sequence a range of species using the new technologies. However, these new technologies produce read lengths as short as 35-40 nucleotides, posing challenges for genome assembly and annotation. Here we review the challenges and describe some of the bioinformatics systems that are being proposed to solve them. We specifically address issues arising from using these technologies in assembly projects, both de novo and for resequencing purposes, as well as efforts to improve genome annotation in the fragmented assemblies produced by short read lengths.},

	abstract = {Early detection of invasive aspergillosis is absolutely required for efficient therapy of this fungal infection. The identification of fungal volatiles in patient breath can be an alternative for the detection of Aspergillus fumigatus that still remains problematic. In this work, we investigated the production of volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) by A. fumigatus in vitro, and we show that volatile production depends on the nutritional environment. A. fumigatus produces a multiplicity of {VOCs}, predominantly terpenes and related compounds. The production of sesquiterpenoid compounds was found to be strongly induced by increased iron concentrations and certain drugs, i.e., pravastatin. Terpenes that were always detectable in large amounts were alpha-pinene, camphene, and limonene, as well as sesquiterpenes, identified as alpha-bergamotene and beta-trans-bergamotene. Other substance classes that were found to be present in the volatome, such as 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, and pyrazines, were found only under specific growth conditions. Drugs that interfere with the terpene biosynthesis pathway influenced the composition of the fungal volatome, and most notably, a block of sesquiterpene biosynthesis by the bisphosphonate alendronate fundamentally changed the {VOC} composition. Using deletion mutants, we also show that a terpene cyclase and a putative kaurene synthase are essential for the synthesis of volatile terpenes by A. fumigatus. The present analysis of in vitro volatile production by A. fumigatus suggests that {VOCs} may be used in the diagnosis of infections caused by this fungus.},

	abstract = {Broad substrate specificity of human P-glycoprotein ({ABCB}1) is an essential feature of multidrug resistance. Transport substrates of P-glycoprotein are mostly hydrophobic and many of them have net positive charge. These compounds partition into the membrane. Utilizing the energy of {ATP} hydrolysis, P-glycoprotein is thought to take up substrates from the cytoplasmic lea. et of the plasma membrane and to transport them to the outside of the cell. We examined this model by molecular dynamics simulation of the lipid bilayer, in the presence of transport substrates together with an atomic resolution structural model of P-glycoprotein. Taken together with previous electron paramagnetic resonance studies, the results suggest that most transported drugs are concentrated near the surface zone of the inner lea. et of the plasma membrane. Here the drugs can easily diffuse laterally into the drug-binding site of P-glycoprotein through an open cleft. It was concluded that the initial high-affinity drug-binding site was located in the interfacial surface area of P-glycoprotein in contact with the membrane interface. Based on these results and our recent kinetic studies, a "solvation exchange'' drug transport mechanism of P-glycoprotein is discussed. A molecular basis for the improved colchicine transport efficiency by the much-studied colchicine-resistance G185V mutant human P-glycoprotein is also provided.},

	abstract = {Second-generation bioethanol produced from various lignocellulosic materials, such as wood, agricultural or forest residues, has the potential to be a valuable substitute for, or a complement to, gasoline. One of the crucial steps in the ethanol production is the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and cellulose to monomer sugars. The most promising method for hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose is by use of enzymes, i.e. cellulases. However, in order to make the raw material accessible to the enzymes some kind of pretreatment is necessary. During the last few years a large number of pretreatment methods have been developed, comprising methods working at low {pH}, i.e. acid based, medium {pH} (without addition of catalysts), and high {pH}, i.e. with a base as catalyst. Many methods have been shown to result in high sugar yields, above 90\% of theoretical for agricultural residues, especially for corn stover. For more recalcitrant materials, e.g. softwood, acid hydrolysis and steam pretreatment with acid catalyst seem to be the methods that can be used to obtain high sugar and ethanol yields. However, for more accurate comparison of different pretreatment methods it is necessary to improve the assessment methods under real process conditions. The whole process must be considered when a performance evaluation is to be made, as the various pretreatment methods give different types of materials. (Hemicellulose sugars can be obtained either in the liquid as monomer or oligomer sugars, or in the solid material to various extents; lignin can be either in the liquid or remain in the solid part; the composition and amount/concentration of possible inhibitory compounds also vary.) This will affect how the enzymatic hydrolysis should be performed (e.g. with or without hemicellulases), how the lignin is recovered and also the use of the lignin co-product.},

	abstract = {There is increasing, but largely indirect, evidence pointing to an effect of commensal gut microbiota on the central nervous system ({CNS}). However, it is unknown whether lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus could have a direct effect on neurotransmitter receptors in the {CNS} in normal, healthy animals. {GABA} is the main {CNS} inhibitory neurotransmitter and is significantly involved in regulating many physiological and psychological processes. Alterations in central {GABA} receptor expression are implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression, which are highly comorbid with functional bowel disorders. In this work, we show that chronic treatment with L. rhamnosus ({JB}-1) induced region-dependent alterations in {GABAB}1b {mRNA} in the brain with increases in cortical regions (cingulate and prelimbic) and concomitant reductions in expression in the hippocampus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus, in comparison with control-fed mice. In addition, L. rhamnosus ({JB}-1) reduced {GABAAα}2 {mRNA} expression in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but increased {GABAAα}2 in the hippocampus. Importantly, L. rhamnosus ({JB}-1) reduced stress-induced corticosterone and anxiety- and depression-related behavior. Moreover, the neurochemical and behavioral effects were not found in vagotomized mice, identifying the vagus as a major modulatory constitutive communication pathway between the bacteria exposed to the gut and the brain. Together, these findings highlight the important role of bacteria in the bidirectional communication of the gut–brain axis and suggest that certain organisms may prove to be useful therapeutic adjuncts in stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression.},

	abstract = {The increased use of antifungal agents in recent years has resulted in the development of resistance to these drugs. The significant clinical implication of resistance has led to heightened interest in the study of antifungal resistance from different angles. In this article we discuss antifungal susceptibility testing, the mode of action of antifungals and mechanisms of resistance. Antifungals are grouped into five groups on the basis of their site of action: azoles, which inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol (the main fungal sterol); polyenes, which bind to fungal membrane sterol, resulting in the formation of aqueous pores through which essential cytoplasmic materials leak out; allylamines, which block ergosterol biosynthesis, leading to accumulation of squalene (which is toxic to the cells); candins (inhibitors of the fungal cell wall), which function by inhibiting the synthesis of β 1,3-glucan (the major structural polymer of the cell wall); and flucytosine, which inhibits macromolecular synthesis. Different mechanisms contribute to the resistance of antifungal agents. These mechanisms include modification of {ERG}11 gene at the molecular level (gene mutation, conversion and overexpression), over expression of specific drug efflux pumps, alteration in sterol biosynthesis, and reduction in the intracellular concentration of target enzymes. Approaches to prevent and control the emergence of antifungal resistance include prudent use of antifungals, treatment with the appropriate antifungal and conducting surveillance studies to determine the frequency of resistance.

Their biosynthesis is primarily governed by large iterative multifunctional type I polyketide synthases. Although there has been good progress studying filamentous non-lichenized fungi, there is limited information on polyketide biosynthesis in lichens and their mycobionts, due to their slow growth, difficulties in establishing pure cultures, and the absence of methods for direct genetic manipulation. However, heterologous expression in a surrogate host offers an alternative approach for exploring lichen polyketide biosynthesis. Here, we report cloning of a type I polyketide synthase gene from the foliose lichen Solorina crocea and its heterologous transcription in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, including processing of the transcript. No new polyketide product was detected. The lichen polyketide synthase showed greatest homology with uncharacterized genes from filamentous fungi and lower homology with proteins catalysing biosynthesis of the decaketide alternapyrone and the tetraketide side-chain of squalestatin. The technology platform utilized here presents a useful tool for functional characterization of fungal biosynthetic genes and provides a means for novel production of valuable compounds.},

The antiporter mediates the exchange of glycerol-3-phosphate for inorganic phosphate across the membrane. Its N- and C-terminal domains exhibit a pseudo 2-fold symmetry along an axis perpendicular to the membrane. Eight of the twelve transmembrane alpha-helices are arranged around a centrally located substrate translocation pore that is closed off at the periplasmic surface. Present at the beginning of the pore are two arginine residues that presumably comprise the substrate-binding site which is accessible only from the cytosol, suggesting an inward-facing conformation for the transporter. The central loop connecting the N- and C-terminal domains is partially disordered and exhibits reduced susceptibility to trypsin in the presence of substrate, indicating conformational changes.

Of these, toxicological and exposure data were gathered for the 15 {MVOCs} most often analysed and reported in buildings with moisture and microbial damage. The most obvious health effect of {MVOC} exposure is eye and upper-airway irritation. However, in human experimental exposure studies, symptoms of irritation have appeared at {MVOC} concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than those measured indoors (single {MVOC} levels in indoor environments have ranged from a few ng/m(3) up to 1 mg/m(3)). This is also supported by dose-dependent sensory-irritation response, as determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials mouse bioassay.

Chromosomal regions flanking T-{DNA} insertions were rescued by inverse {PCR}, sequenced and used to search the M. oryzae genome assembly. Among the 175 insertions for which at least one flank was rescued, 137 had integrated in single-copy regions of the genome, 17 were in repeated sequences, one had no match to the genome, and the remainder were unassigned due to illegitimate T-{DNA} integration events. These included in order of abundance: head-to-tail tandem insertions, right border excision failures, left border excision failures and insertion of one T-{DNA} into another. The left borders of the T-{DNA} were frequently truncated and inserted in sequences with micro-homology to the left terminus. By contrast the right borders were less prone to degradation and appeared to have been integrated in a homology-independent manner. Gross genome rearrangements rarely occurred when the T-{DNAs} integrated in single-copy regions, although most insertions did cause small deletions at the target site. Significant insertion bias was detected, with promoters receiving two times more T-{DNA} hits than expected, and open reading frames receiving three times fewer. In addition, we found that the distribution of T-{DNA} inserts among the M. oryzae chromosomes was not random.

	abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that volatile organic compounds play an import role during interactions between soil microorganisms. Here, we examined the possible involvement of volatiles in the interaction of Collimonas bacteria with soil fungi. The genus Collimonas is known for its ability to grow at the expense of living fungi (mycophagy), and antifungal volatiles may contribute to the attack of fungi by these bacteria. We analyzed the composition of volatiles produced by Collimonas on agar under different nutrient conditions and studied the effect on fungal growth. The volatiles had a negative effect on the growth of a broad spectrum of fungal species. Collimonas bacteria did also produce volatiles in sand microcosms supplied with artificial root exudates. The production of volatiles in sand microcosms was enhanced by the presence of fungi. The overall picture that we get from our study is that antifungal volatiles produced by Collimonas could play an important role in realizing its mycophagous lifestyle. The current work is also interesting for understanding the ecological relevance of volatile production by soil bacteria in general as we found strong influences of root exudates composition and incubation conditions on the spectrum of volatiles produced.},

To study how microbes establish themselves in a mammalian gut environment, we colonized germ-free mice with microbial communities from human, zebrafish, and termite guts, human skin and tongue, soil, and estuarine microbial mats. Bacteria from these foreign environments colonized and persisted in the mouse gut; their capacity to metabolize dietary and host carbohydrates and bile acids correlated with colonization success. Cohousing mice harboring these xenomicrobiota or a mouse cecal microbiota, along with germ-free “bystanders,” revealed the success of particular bacterial taxa in invading guts with established communities and empty gut habitats. Unanticipated patterns of ecological succession were observed; for example, a soil-derived bacterium dominated even in the presence of bacteria from other gut communities (zebrafish and termite), and human-derived bacteria colonized germ-free bystander mice before mouse-derived organisms. This approach can be generalized to address a variety of mechanistic questions about succession, including succession in the context of microbiota-directed therapeutics.},

The analysis revealed the dynamics of five major classes of bacterial communities and showed that some communities change markedly over short time periods, whereas others are relatively stable. Modeling community stability using new quantitative measures indicates that deviation from stability correlates with time in the menstrual cycle, bacterial community composition, and sexual activity. The women studied are healthy; thus, it appears that neither variation in community composition per se nor higher levels of observed diversity (co-dominance) are necessarily indicative of dysbiosis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Following Lichtenstein hernia repair, up to 25\% of patients experience prolonged postoperative and chronic pain as well as discomfort in the groin. One of the underlying causes of these complaints are the compression or irritation of nerves by the sutures used to fixate the mesh. We compared the level and rate of chronic pain in patients operated with the classical Lichtenstein technique fixated by sutures to patients with sutureless mesh fixation technique.


{METHODS}

A two-armed randomized trial with 264 male patients was performed. After consent, patients were randomized preoperatively. For the fixation of the mesh we used either sutures with slow-absorbing material ({PDS} 2.0) (group I, n = 133) or tissue glue (Histoacryl) (group {II}, n = 131). Follow-up examinations were performed after 3, 12 months and after 5 years.


{RESULTS}

Patient characteristics in the two groups were similar. No cross-over between groups was observed. After 5 years, long-term follow-up could be completed for 59\% of subjects. After 5 years, 10/85 (11.7\%) patients in group I and 3/70 (4.2\%) in group {II} suffered from chronic pain in the groin region (P = 0.108). The operation time was significantly shorter in group {II} (79 min vs 73 min, P = 0.01). One early recurrence occurred in group {II} (3 months). The recurrence rate was 0 and 0\% after 12 months and 5.9\% (5/85) and 10\% (7/70) after 5 years in group I and group {II}, respectively (P = 0.379).


{CONCLUSION}

After 5 years, the two techniques of mesh fixation resulted in similar rates of chronic pain. Whereas recurrence rates were comparable, fixation of the mesh with tissue glue decreased operating room time significantly. Hence, suture less mesh fixation with Histoacryl is a sensible alternative to suture fixation and should be especially considered for patients prone to pain.},

With permease embedded in the native membrane, mutant Phe27--{\textgreater}Cys or Phe28--{\textgreater}Cys is readily labeled with [14C]-N-ethylmaleimide ({NEM}), while mutant Phe29--{\textgreater}Cys, Phe30--{\textgreater}Cys, or Phe31--{\textgreater}Cys reacts less effectively. beta,D-Galactopyranosyl 1-thio-beta,D-galactopyranoside ({TDG}) has little or no effect on the reactivity of Phe27--{\textgreater}Cys, Phe29--{\textgreater}Cys, or Phe30--{\textgreater}Cys permease. Remarkably, however, Pro31--{\textgreater}Cys permease which is essentially unreactive in the absence of ligand becomes highly reactive in the presence of {TDG}. Ligand also enhances the {NEM} reactivity of the mutant with Cys in place of Pro28 which is presumably on the same face of helix I as position 31. The five single-Cys mutants which also contain a biotin acceptor domain in the middle cytoplasmic loop were purified by monomeric avidin-affinity chromatography in dodecyl beta,D-maltoside and subjected to site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. Mutants Phe27--{\textgreater}Cys, Phe29--{\textgreater}Cys, and Phe30--{\textgreater}Cys react rapidly with 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid ({MIANS}), and reactivity is not altered in the presence of {TDG}. In striking contrast, mutants Pro28--{\textgreater}Cys and Pro31--{\textgreater}Cys react extremely slowly with {MIANS} in the absent of ligand, and {TDG} dramatically enhances reactivity.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

Perturbations of the composition of the symbiotic intestinal microbiota can have profound consequences for host metabolism and immunity. In mice, segmented filamentous bacteria ({SFB}) direct the accumulation of potentially proinflammatory Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria. We present the genome sequence of {SFB} isolated from monocolonized mice, which classifies {SFB} phylogenetically as a unique member of Clostridiales with a highly reduced genome. Annotation analysis demonstrates that {SFB} depend on their environment for amino acids and essential nutrients and may utilize host and dietary glycans for carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Comparative analyses reveal that {SFB} are functionally related to members of the genus Clostridium and several pathogenic or commensal “minimal” genera, including Finegoldia, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, and Phytoplasma. However, {SFB} are functionally distinct from all 1200 examined genomes, indicating a gene complement representing biology relatively unique to their role as a gut commensal closely tied to host metabolism and immunity.},

Volatiles were collected by diffusive sampling onto tubes with carbon black for 2 wk, and then extracted with diethylether. Ether extracts were analysed by gas chromatography ({GC}) and volatiles were characterized by mass spectrometry ({MS}) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}). Their retention indices ({RI}) were compared with those of authentic compounds. In total, 196 different volatile metabolites were characterized from the taxa investigated. About 70 metabolites were assigned by {MS} as isomeric sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C15H24), such as β-caryophyllene, α-bergamotene and thujopsene. However, the majority of sesquiterpenes have only been characterized by {RI} and mass spectral data generated at 70 {eV}, in a 9 peak index. Computer matching of spectral data with spectra in the {NIST} library showed that these compounds could not be assigned. A number of monoterpenes, alcohols, esters, ketones, alkenes and a few aromatic compounds were also produced. Geosmin and 2-methyl-isoborneol, reported as contributing to mouldy/earthy off flavours, were both produced by a number of different taxa, reported here for the first time. More than half of the metabolites were only detected from one species and nearly all taxa each produced a unique profile of volatile metabolites. Thus, the present study has demonstrated the potential of species of Penicillium as producers of a great diversity of volatile metabolites, likely to be useful in chemosystematics.},

Until now, these bacteria have not been cultured in vitro. Recently, a 16S {rRNA} sequence analysis revealed that {SFB} isolated from mice represent a distinct subline within the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria. Since {SFB} isolated from mice, rats, and chickens are known to be host specific, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships among {SFB} obtained from these three hosts. Total {DNAs} from the intestinal floras of chickens and rats were used as templates for {PCR} amplification of 16S {rRNA} genes. {PCR} products were cloned and screened by a dot blot hybridization procedure to identify homologous sequences that cross-reacted with mouse {SFB}-specific oligonucleotide probes. A phylogenetic analysis of these 16S ribosomal {DNA} sequences revealed that {SFB} isolated from these three hosts form a natural group, which is peripherally related to the genus Clostridium sensu stricto (group I Clostridium). The {SFB} obtained from chickens, rats, and mice had closely related, albeit different, 16S {rRNA} gene sequences. The observed levels of 16S {rRNA} sequence divergence, ca. 1.5 to 3\%, together with host specificity, suggest that {SFB} isolated from mice, rats, and chickens represent different species and that coevolution of the {SFB} and their hosts occurred. “Candidatus Arthromitus” is proposed as the provisional generic name for this group of organisms.},

By contrast, the closely related aristolochene synthase from Aspergillus terreus cyclized farnesyl diphosphate only to (+)-aristolochene (4). Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues in two highly conserved Mg(2+)-binding domains led in most cases to reductions in both k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) as well as increases in the proportion of (S)-(-)germacrene A (2), with the E252Q mutant of the P. roqueforti aristolochene synthase producing only (-)-2. The P. roqueforti D115N, N244L, and S248A/E252D mutants were inactive, as was the A. terreus mutant E227Q. The P. roqueforti mutant Y92F displayed a 100-fold reduction in k(cat) that was offset by a 50-fold decrease in K(m), resulting in a relatively minor 2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency, k(cat)/K(m). The finding that Y92F produced (+)-aristolochene (4) as 81\% of the product, accompanied by 7\% 5 and 12\% 2, rules out Tyr-92 as the active site Lewis acid that is responsible for protonation of the germacrene A intermediate in the formation of aristolochene (4).},

Host genetics and the gut microbiome can both influence metabolic phenotypes. However, whether host genetic variation shapes the gut microbiome and interacts with it to affect host phenotype is unclear. Here, we compared microbiotas across \&gt;1,000 fecal samples obtained from the {TwinsUK} population, including 416 twin pairs. We identified many microbial taxa whose abundances were influenced by host genetics. The most heritable taxon, the family Christensenellaceae, formed a co-occurrence network with other heritable Bacteria and with methanogenic Archaea. Furthermore, Christensenellaceae and its partners were enriched in individuals with low body mass index ({BMI}). An obese-associated microbiome was amended with Christensenella minuta, a cultured member of the Christensenellaceae, and transplanted to germ-free mice. C. minuta amendment reduced weight gain and altered the microbiome of recipient mice. Our findings indicate that host genetics influence the composition of the human gut microbiome and can do so in ways that impact host metabolism.},

Very little was known about the metabolites that were produced by the fungi that grew on damp building materials, and almost nothing had been reported on their occurrence in buildings. As a consequence, the focus was on speculations involving the fungal toxins that occur in agriculture. Over the past decade, particularly in the last 5 years, considerable progress has been made concerning the relevant toxins from fungi that grow on damp building materials. This paper summarizes the available data on the low-molecular-weight toxins reliably known from fungi common on damp building materials, the toxins that have been measured on mouldy building materials and the new understanding of the role that they play in the documented health effects of individuals living and working in damp and mouldy buildings.},

	abstract = {Curacin A is a polyketide synthase ({PKS})-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-derived natural product with potent anticancer properties generated by the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Type I modular {PKS} assembly lines typically employ a thioesterase ({TE}) domain to off-load carboxylic acid or macrolactone products from an adjacent acyl carrier protein ({ACP}) domain. In a striking departure from this scheme the curacin A {PKS} employs tandem sulfotransferase and {TE} domains to form a terminal alkene moiety. Sulfotransferase sulfonation of β-hydroxy-acyl-{ACP} is followed by {TE} hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and sulfate elimination (Gu, L., Wang, B., Kulkarni, A., Gehret, J. J., Lloyd, K. R., Gerwick, L., Gerwick, W. H., Wipf, P., Håkansson, K., Smith, J. L., and Sherman, D. H. (2009) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131, 16033–16035). With low sequence identity to other {PKS} {TEs} ({\textless}15\%), the curacin {TE} represents a new thioesterase subfamily. The 1.7-Å curacin {TE} crystal structure reveals how the familiar α/β-hydrolase architecture is adapted to specificity for β-sulfated substrates. A Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad is centered in an open active site cleft between the core domain and a lid subdomain. Unlike {TEs} from other {PKSs}, the lid is fixed in an open conformation on one side by dimer contacts of a protruding helix and on the other side by an arginine anchor from the lid into the core. Adjacent to the catalytic triad, another arginine residue is positioned to recognize the substrate β-sulfate group. The essential features of the curacin {TE} are conserved in sequences of five other putative bacterial {ACP}-{ST}-{TE} tridomains. Formation of a sulfate leaving group as a biosynthetic strategy to facilitate acyl chain decarboxylation is of potential value as a route to hydrocarbon biofuels.},

A strain of Streptomyces was found to produce active compounds named {UCF}1-A, {UCF}1-B, and {UCF}1-C. Structural determination of these compounds revealed that {UCF}1-C is identical to the known antibiotic, manumycin, whereas {UCF}1-A and {UCF}1-B are structurally related to manumycin. All three {UCF}1 compounds suppress the lethality of gpa1 disruption, with {UCF}1-C exhibiting the strongest activity. {UCF}1 inhibits yeast as well as rat brain {PFT}. Fifty percent inhibition of yeast {PFT} activity is observed with 5 {microM} {UCF}1-C. Kinetic analyses of the inhibition suggest that {UCF}1-C acts as a competitive inhibitor of {PFT} with respect to farnesyl pyrophosphate, exhibiting a Ki of 1.2 {microM}, whereas the same compound appears to act as a noncompetitive inhibitor of {PFT} with respect to the farnesyl acceptor, the Ras protein. {UCF}1-C shows significant activity to inhibit the growth of Ki-ras-transformed fibrosarcoma, raising the possibility of its use as an antitumor drug.},

Oxidants generated by mitochondria appear to be the major source of the oxidative lesions that accumulate with age. Several mitochondrial functions decline with age. The contributing factors include the intrinsic rate of proton leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane (a correlate of oxidant formation), decreased membrane fluidity, and decreased levels and function of cardiolipin, which supports the function of many of the proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Acetyl-L-carnitine, a high-energy mitochondrial substrate, appears to reverse many age associated deficits in cellular function, in part by increasing cellular {ATP} production. Such evidence supports the suggestion that age-associated accumulation of mitochondrial deficits due to oxidative damage is likely to be a major contributor to cellular, tissue, and organismal aging.},

Isothermal titration calorimetry shows binding characterized with dissociation constants in the range 0.35-7.64 \{micro\}M for plasmin and {tPA} (lower values with more negative phospholipids). The interactions are endothermic and thermodynamically driven by an increase in entropy, probably caused by the rearrangements in the ordered gel structure of the phospholipids (in line with the stronger inhibition at gel phase temperatures compared with liquid crystalline phase temperatures).

	abstract = {P-glycoprotein (P-gp) the multidrug transporter is a well-characterised member of the super-family of {ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) transporters, and mediates the clearance of xenotoxins against steep concentration gradients at the expense of {ATP} hydrolysis. The primary function of this protein is to prevent the uptake of toxic compounds from the gut into the body, and to protect vital structures such as the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, testis, foetus and bone marrow against toxins. Although P-gp transports a wide range of compounds, which is advantageous, it can also be a disadvantage and may interfere with the delivery of drugs to target tissues resulting in multidrug resistance. In the present review: (i) we consider our current understanding of the structure of P-glycoprotein, (ii) discuss substrate binding and its coupling to {ATPase} activity, (iii) provide insight into key features which define P-glycoprotein substrates/inhibitors and the ability to predict potential substrates in silico, (iv) provide an overview of existing models of pump function and (v) present emerging concepts into the regulation of P-glycoprotein expression, with particular reference to multidrug resistance.

	abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum {MSA}35 [wild-type ({WT}) strain] is an antagonistic Fusarium that lives in association with a consortium of bacteria belonging to the genera Serratia, Achromobacter, Bacillus and Stenotrophomonas in an Italian soil suppressive to Fusarium wilt. Typing experiments and virulence tests provided evidence that the F. oxysporum isolate when cured of the bacterial symbionts [the cured ({CU}) form], is pathogenic, causing wilt symptoms identical to those caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae. Here, we demonstrate that small volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) emitted from the {WT} strain negatively influence the mycelial growth of different formae speciales of F. oxysporum. Furthermore, these {VOCs} repress gene expression of two putative virulence genes in F. oxysporum lactucae strain Fuslat10, a fungus against which the {WT} strain {MSA} 35 has antagonistic activity. The {VOC} profile of the {WT} and {CU} fungus shows different compositions. Sesquiterpenes, mainly caryophyllene, were present in the headspace only of {WT} {MSA} 35. No sesquiterpenes were found in the volatiles of ectosymbiotic Serratia sp. strain {DM}1 and Achromobacter sp. strain {MM}1. Bacterial volatiles had no effects on the growth of the different ff. spp. of F. oxysporum examined. Hyphae {grownwithVOCfrom} {WT} F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae strain {MSA} 35 were hydrophobic whereas those grown without {VOCs} were not, suggesting a correlation between the presence of volatiles in the atmosphere and the phenotype of the mycelium. This is the first report of {VOC} production by antagonistic F. oxysporum {MSA}35 and their effects on pathogenic F. oxysporum. The results obtained in this work led us to propose a new potential direct long-distance mechanism for antagonism by F. oxysporum {MSA} 35 mediated by {VOCs}. Antagonism could be the consequence of both reduction of pathogen mycelial growth and inhibition of pathogen virulence gene expression.},

	abstract = {Modular polyketide synthases ({PKSs}) are large multi-enzymatic, multi-domain megasynthases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of a class of pharmaceutically important natural products, namely polyketides. These enzymes harbor a set of repetitive active sites termed modules and the domains present in each module dictate the chemical moiety that would add to a growing polyketide chain. This modular logic of biosynthesis has been exploited with reasonable success to produce several novel compounds by genetic manipulation. However, for harnessing their vast potential of combinatorial biosynthesis, it is essential to develop knowledge based in silico approaches for correlating the sequence and domain organization of {PKSs} to their polyketide products. In this work, we have carried out extensive sequence analysis of experimentally characterized {PKS} clusters to develop an automated computational protocol for unambiguous identification of various {PKS} domains in a polypeptide sequence. A structure based approach has been used to identify the putative active site residues of acyltransferase ({AT}) domains, which control the specificities for various starter and extender units during polyketide biosynthesis. On the basis of the analysis of the active site residues and molecular modelling of substrates in the active site of representative {AT} domains, we have identified a crucial residue that is likely to play a major role in discriminating between malonate and methylmalonate during selection of extender groups by this domain. Structural modelling has also explained the experimentally observed chiral preference of {AT} domain in substrate selection. This computational protocol has been used to predict the domain organization and substrate specificity for {PKS} clusters from various microbial genomes. The results of our analysis as well as the computational tools for prediction of domain organization and substrate specificity have been organized in the form of a searchable computerized database ({PKSDB}). {PKSDB} would serve as a valuable tool for identification of polyketide products biosynthesized by uncharacterized {PKS} clusters. This database can also provide guidelines for rational design of experiments to engineer novel polyketides+ .},

Ecological insight into core microbiomes can be enriched by 'omics approaches that assess gene expression, thereby extending the concept of the core beyond taxonomically defined membership to community function and behaviour. Parameters defined by traditional ecology theory, such as composition, phylogeny, persistence and connectivity, will also create a more complex portrait of the core microbiome and advance understanding of the role of key microorganisms and functions within and across ecosystems.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Filamentous fungi synthesize many secondary metabolites and are rich in genes encoding proteins involved in their biosynthesis. Genes from the same pathway are often clustered and co-expressed in particular conditions. Such secondary metabolism gene clusters evolve rapidly through multiple rearrangements, duplications and losses. It has long been suspected that clusters can be transferred horizontally between species, but few concrete examples have been described so far.{RESULTS}:In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, the avirulence gene {ACE}1 that codes for a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase ({PKS}-{NRPS}) belongs to a cluster of 15 genes involved in secondary metabolism. Additional related clusters were detected in the ascomycetes Chaetomium globosum, Stagonospora nodorum and Aspergillus clavatus. Gene-by-gene phylogenetic analysis showed that in C. globosum and M. grisea, the evolution of these {ACE}1-like clusters is characterized by successive complex duplication events including tandem duplication within the M. grisea cluster. The phylogenetic trees also present evidence that at least five of the six genes in the homologous {ACE}1 gene cluster in A. clavatus originated by horizontal transfer from a donor closely related to M. grisea.{CONCLUSION}:The {ACE}1 cluster originally identified in M. grisea is shared by only few fungal species. Its sporadic distribution within euascomycetes is mainly explained by multiple events of duplication and losses. However, because A. clavatus contains an {ACE}1 cluster of only six genes, we propose that horizontal transfer from a relative of M. grisea into an ancestor of A. clavatus provides a much simpler explanation of the observed data than the alternative of multiple events of duplication and losses of parts of the cluster.},

	abstract = {The role of docosahexaenoic acid ({DHA}) in the fluidity of the annular lipid regions and their associated membrane-bound proteins is still not as well understood as that in the global (bulk) lipid regions. We therefore studied the effects of dietary {DHA} on the relationship between annular and global lipid fluidity and membrane-bound enzymes such as 5'-nucleotidase and Mg2+-{ATPase} in the rat bile canalicular membrane. Dietary {DHA} caused significant increases in 5'-nucleotidase and Mg2+-{ATPase} activity and in global and annular lipid fluidity, a higher increase in fluidity in the annular lipids than the global lipids, and a decrease in the cholesterol-to-phospholipid molar ratio in the canalicular membrane. Plasma total cholesterol and {LDL} cholesterol decreased, and fecal cholesterol increased in the {DHA}-fed rats. No changes were observed in oxidative markers, but glutathione peroxidase increased in the liver with {DHA} feeding. Annular lipid fluidity, but not global lipid fluidity, correlated remarkably well with {DHA}, synchronously with the activities of 5'-nucleotidase and Mg2+-{ATPase}. The data indicate that the {DHA}-induced increase in annular lipid fluidity is responsible for the increases observed in the enzyme activity. We therefore concluded that the increased activity of membrane-bound enzymes and transporters induced by {DHA} and the concomitant increase in annular lipid fluidity comprise one of the mechanisms involved in {DHA}-induced clearance of plasma cholesterol. -- Hashimoto, M., M.

The development of a genetic system for the dynemicin producer Micromonospora chersina confirmed, for the first time, the requirement of the putative enediyne core biosynthetic genes ({dynE}8, U14 and U15) and a tailoring oxidase gene (orf23) for dynemicin production. Cloning and sequence analysis of a 76 kb of genomic sequence region containing {dynE}8 revealed a variety of genes conserved among known enediyne loci. Surprisingly, this fragment and flanking chromosomal {DNA} lacked any obvious genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the anthraquinone, suggesting that the location of genes encoding for the biosynthesis of the dynemicin enediyne core and the dynemicin anthraquinone are chromosomally distinct.

We compared the skin microbiome at the strain level and genome level of Propionibacterium acnes, a dominant skin commensal, between 49 acne patients and 52 healthy individuals by sampling the pilosebaceous units on their noses. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that although the relative abundances of P. acnes were similar, the strain population structures were significantly different in the two cohorts. Certain strains were highly associated with acne, and other strains were enriched in healthy skin. By sequencing 66 previously unreported P. acnes strains and comparing 71 P. acnes genomes, we identified potential genetic determinants of various P. acnes strains in association with acne or health. Our analysis suggests that acquired {DNA} sequences and bacterial immune elements may have roles in determining virulence properties of P. acnes strains, and some could be future targets for therapeutic interventions. This study demonstrates a previously unreported paradigm of commensal strain populations that could explain the pathogenesis of human diseases.

	volume = {4},
	issn = {1754-6834},
	doi = {10.1186/1754-6834-4-21},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Isobutanol can be a better biofuel than ethanol due to its higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity. Furthermore, the branched-chain structure of isobutanol gives a higher octane number than the isomeric n-butanol. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen as the production host because of its relative tolerance to alcohols, robustness in industrial fermentations, and the possibility for future combination of isobutanol production with fermentation of lignocellulosic materials.
{RESULTS}: The yield of isobutanol was improved from 0.16 to 0.97 mg per g glucose by simultaneous overexpression of biosynthetic genes {ILV}2, {ILV}3, and {ILV}5 in valine metabolism in anaerobic fermentation of glucose in mineral medium in S. cerevisiae. Isobutanol yield was further improved by twofold by the additional overexpression of {BAT}2, encoding the cytoplasmic branched-chain amino-acid aminotransferase. Overexpression of {ILV}6, encoding the regulatory subunit of Ilv2, in the {ILV}2 {ILV}3 {ILV}5 overexpression strain decreased isobutanol production yield by threefold. In aerobic cultivations in shake flasks in mineral medium, the isobutanol yield of the {ILV}2 {ILV}3 {ILV}5 overexpression strain and the reference strain were 3.86 and 0.28 mg per g glucose, respectively. They increased to 4.12 and 2.4 mg per g glucose in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose ({YPD}) complex medium under aerobic conditions, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overexpression of genes {ILV}2, {ILV}3, {ILV}5, and {BAT}2 in valine metabolism led to an increase in isobutanol production in S. cerevisiae. Additional overexpression of {ILV}6 in the {ILV}2 {ILV}3 {ILV}5 overexpression strain had a negative effect, presumably by increasing the sensitivity of Ilv2 to valine inhibition, thus weakening the positive impact of overexpression of {ILV}2, {ILV}3, and {ILV}5 on isobutanol production. Aerobic cultivations of the {ILV}2 {ILV}3 {ILV}5 overexpression strain and the reference strain showed that supplying amino acids in cultivation media gave a substantial improvement in isobutanol production for the reference strain, but not for the {ILV}2 {ILV}3 {ILV}5 overexpression strain. This result implies that other constraints besides the enzyme activities for the supply of 2-ketoisovalerate may become bottlenecks for isobutanol production after {ILV}2, {ILV}3, and {ILV}5 have been overexpressed, which most probably includes the valine inhibition to Ilv2.},

The volume and complexity of data from {RNA}-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. {TopHat} and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput {mRNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use {TopHat} and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including {CummeRbund}, a tool for visualizing {RNA}-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with {RNA}-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and {\textasciitilde}1 h of hands-on time.

After removal of {VOCs} released from the growth system, 54 {VOCs} were detected including 15 novel compounds not reported in fungi before. Principle component and cluster analyses revealed that fungal species differ in their odor profiles, particularly in the pattern of sesquiterpenes. The functional groups and species could be chemotyped by using their specific emission patterns. The different ecological groups could be predicted with probabilities of 90-99\%, whereas for the individual species the probabilities varied between 55\% and 83\%.

Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne {PKS} is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families.

	doi = {10.1128/AEM.02127-06},
	abstract = {In filamentous fungi, {RNA} silencing is an attractive alternative to disruption experiments for the functional analysis of genes. We adapted the gene encoding the autofluorescent {DsRed} protein as a reporter to monitor the silencing process in fungal transformants. Using the cephalosporin C producer Acremonium chrysogenum, strains showing a high level of expression of the {DsRed} gene were constructed, resulting in red fungal colonies. Transfer of a hairpin-expressing vector carrying fragments of the {DsRed} gene allowed efficient silencing of {DsRed} expression. Monitoring of this process by Northern hybridization, real-time {PCR} quantification, and spectrofluorometric measurement of the {DsRed} protein confirmed that downregulation of gene expression can be observed at different expression levels. The usefulness of the {DsRed} silencing system was demonstrated by investigating cosilencing of {DsRed} together with {pcbC}, encoding the isopenicillin N synthase, an enzyme involved in cephalosporin C biosynthesis. Downregulation of {pcbC} can be detected easily by a bioassay measuring the antibiotic activity of individual strains. In addition, the presence of the isopenicillin N synthase was investigated by Western blot hybridization. All transformants having a colorless phenotype showed simultaneous downregulation of the {pcbC} gene, albeit at different levels. The {RNA}-silencing system presented here should be a powerful genetic tool for strain improvement and genome-wide analysis of this biotechnologically important filamentous fungus.},

In addition, control models were created with shuffled sequences, to mimic poor quality homology models.

Comparison of the behavior of modeled structures with the crystal structures in molecular dynamics simulations provided a metric for model quality.

Soon after these breakthroughs, an exponential rate of genome sequencing was established, with a doubling time of approximately 20 months for bacteria and approximately 34 months for archaea. Comparative analysis of the hundreds of sequenced bacterial and dozens of archaeal genomes leads to several generalizations on the principles of genome organization and evolution. A crucial finding that enables functional characterization of the sequenced genomes and evolutionary reconstruction is that the majority of archaeal and bacterial genes have conserved orthologs in other, often, distant organisms. However, comparative genomics also shows that horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}) is a dominant force of prokaryotic evolution, along with the loss of genetic material resulting in genome contraction. A crucial component of the prokaryotic world is the mobilome, the enormous collection of viruses, plasmids and other selfish elements, which are in constant exchange with more stable chromosomes and serve as {HGT} vehicles. Thus, the prokaryotic genome space is a tightly connected, although compartmentalized, network, a novel notion that undermines the ‘Tree of Life’ model of evolution and requires a new conceptual framework and tools for the study of prokaryotic evolution.},

We, therefore, established a concept to avoid these sutures by attaching the prosthesis with glue. After a pilot study, a randomised prospective trial was started. The aim of our study was to compare the results of the classical Lichtenstein repair (group 1) vs the "Sutureless Lichtenstein" (group 2) in terms of postoperative complications and recurrences. Operative access and management of the hernial sac was equal to Lichtenstein for both groups. In group 1, we sutured the mesh with {PDS} 2/0; in group 2, the mesh was glued with n-butyl-cyanoacrylate. In both groups, the operation was then completed according to Lichtenstein, and unrestricted activity was allowed after 2 weeks. A total of 46 patients have been operated on. The follow-up results at 3 weeks and [3 months] were: group 1 ( n=24) vs group 2 ( n=22): recurrences 0 [0] vs 0 [0], minor pain 8 [4] vs 4 [1], local numbness 14 [10] vs 10 [6]. No adhesive-related complications were seen. Patients will be followed for 2 years. The results in group 2 were excellent, and there was no difference vs group 1.

	abstract = {The endophytic fungi of woody plants may be diverse as often claimed, and likewise, they may be functionally novel as demonstrated in a few studies. However, the endophyte taxa that are most frequently reported tend to belong to fungal groups composed of morphologically similar endophytes and parasites. Thus, it is plausible that endophytes are known (i.e., described) parasites in a latent phase within the host. If this null hypothesis were true, endophytes would represent neither additional fungal diversity distinct from parasite diversity nor a symbiont community likely to be novel ecologically. To be synonymous with parasites of the host, endophytes should at least be most closely related to those same parasites. Here we report that seven distinct parasites of Pinus monticola do not occur as endophytes. The majority of endophytes of P. monticola (90\% of 2,019 cultures) belonged to one fungal family, the Rhytismataceae. However, not a single rhytismataceous endophyte was found to be most closely related by sequence homology to the three known rhytismataceous parasites of P. monticola. Similarly, neither endophytic Mycosphaerella nor endophytic Rhizosphaera isolates were most closely related to known parasites of P. monticola. Morphologically, the endophytes of P. monticola can be confounded with the parasites of the same host. However, they are actually most closely related to, but distinct from, parasites of other species of Pinus. If endophytes are generally unknown species, then estimates of 1 million endophytes (i.e., approximately 1 in 14 of all species of life) seem reasonable.},

	abstract = {The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited builds on the 2000 report Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience for Scientists and Engineers. That ground-breaking report assessed the postdoctoral experience and provided principles, action points, and recommendations to enhance that experience. Since the publication of the 2000 report, the postdoctoral landscape has changed considerably. The percentage of {PhDs} who pursue postdoctoral training is growing steadily and spreading from the biomedical and physical sciences to engineering and the social sciences. The average length of time spent in postdoctoral positions seems to be increasing. The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited reexamines postdoctoral programs in the United States, focusing on how postdocs are being guided and managed, how institutional practices have changed, and what happens to postdocs after they complete their programs. This book explores important changes that have occurred in postdoctoral practices and the research ecosystem and assesses how well current practices meet the needs of these fledgling scientists and engineers and of the research enterprise. The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited takes a fresh look at current postdoctoral fellows - how many there are, where they are working, in what fields, and for how many years. This book makes recommendations to improve aspects of programs - postdoctoral period of service, title and role, career development, compensation and benefits, and mentoring. Current data on demographics, career aspirations, and career outcomes for postdocs are limited. This report makes the case for better data collection by research institution and data sharing. A larger goal of this study is not only to propose ways to make the postdoctoral system better for the postdoctoral researchers themselves but also to better understand the role that postdoctoral training plays in the research enterprise. It is also to ask whether there are alternative ways to satisfy some of the research and career development needs of postdoctoral researchers that are now being met with several years of advanced training. Postdoctoral researchers are the future of the research enterprise. The discussion and recommendations of The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited will stimulate action toward clarifying the role of postdoctoral researchers and improving their status and experience.},

As the serious effects of global climate change become apparent and access to fossil fuels becomes more limited, metabolic engineers and synthetic biologists are looking towards greener sources for transportation fuels. In recent years, microbial production of high-energy fuels by economically efficient bioprocesses has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional production of transportation fuels. Here, we engineered the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce fatty acid-derived biofuels and chemicals from simple sugars. Specifically, we overexpressed all three fatty acid biosynthesis genes, namely acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase ({ACC}1), fatty acid synthase 1 ({FAS}1) and fatty acid synthase 2 ({FAS}2), in S. cerevisiae. When coupled to triacylglycerol ({TAG}) production, the engineered strain accumulated lipid to more than 17\% of its dry cell weight, a four-fold improvement over the control strain. Understanding that {TAG} cannot be used directly as fuels, we also engineered S. cerevisiae to produce drop-in fuels and chemicals. Altering the terminal “converting enzyme” in the engineered strain led to the production of free fatty acids at a titer of approximately 400 mg/L, fatty alcohols at approximately 100 mg/L and fatty acid ethyl esters (biodiesel) at approximately 5 mg/L directly from simple sugars. We envision that our approach will provide a scalable, controllable and economic route to this important class of chemicals.},

	abstract = {The expression of a plant (Umbellularia californica) medium-chain acyl-acyl carrier protein ({ACP}) thioesterase ({BTE}) {cDNA} in Escherichia coli results in a very high level of extractable medium-chain-specific hydrolytic activity but causes only a minor accumulation of medium-chain fatty acids. {BTE}'s full impact on the bacterial fatty acid synthase is apparent only after expression in a strain deficient in fatty acid degradation, in which {BTE} increases the total fatty acid output of the bacterial cultures fourfold. Laurate (12:0), normally a minor fatty acid component of E. coli, becomes predominant, is secreted into the medium, and can accumulate to a level comparable to the total dry weight of the bacteria. Also, large quantities of 12:1, 14:0, and 14:1 are made. At the end of exponential growth, the pathway of saturated fatty acids is almost 100\% diverted by {BTE} to the production of free medium-chain fatty acids, starving the cells for saturated acyl-{ACP} substrates for lipid biosynthesis. This results in drastic changes in membrane lipid composition from predominantly 16:0 to 18:1. The continued hydrolysis of medium-chain {ACPs} by the {BTE} causes the bacterial fatty acid synthase to produce fatty acids even when membrane production has ceased in stationary phase, which shows that the fatty acid synthesis rate can be uncoupled from phospholipid biosynthesis and suggests that acyl-{ACP} intermediates might normally act as feedback inhibitors for fatty acid synthase. As the fatty acid synthesis is increasingly diverted to medium chains with the onset of stationary phase, the rate of C12 production increases relative to C14 production. This observation is consistent with activity of the {BTE} on free acyl-{ACP} pools, as opposed to its interaction with fatty acid synthase-bound substrates.},

The mechanism of action of the above substances was also investigated.Methods and Results: The applied technique uses 100-well microtitre plate and collects turbidimetric growth data. To produce the inhibition profiles, a wide range of concentrations were tested for each of the three compounds, as well as for carvacrol–thymol mixtures. Following a specific mathematical analysis of the observed inhibition profiles from all compounds, it was suggested that mixtures of carvacrol and thymol gave an additive effect and that the overall inhibition by {OEO} can be attributed mainly to the additive antimicrobial action of these two compounds. Addition of low amounts of each additive: (a) increased permeability of cells to the nuclear stain {EB}, (b) dissipated {pH} gradients as indicated by the {CFDA}-{SE} fluorescent probe irrespective of glucose availability and (c) caused leakage of inorganic ions.Conclusions: Mixing carvacrol and thymol at proper amounts may exert the total inhibition that is evident by oregano essential oil. Such inhibition is due to damage in membrane integrity, which further affects {pH} homeostasis and equilibrium of inorganic ions.Significance and Impact of the Study: The knowledge of extent and mode of inhibition of specific compounds, which are present in plant extracts, may contribute to the successful application of such natural preservatives in foods, since certain combinations of carvacrol–thymol provide as high inhibition as oregano essential oil with a smaller flavour impact.},

In this study we show that the filamentous fungus employs this delivery system to perform new cellular functions, the synthesis, compartmentalization, and export of aflatoxin; this secondary metabolite is one of the most potent naturally occurring carcinogens known. Here we show that a highly pure vesicle-vacuole fraction isolated from under aflatoxin-inducing conditions converts sterigmatocystin, a late intermediate in aflatoxin synthesis, to aflatoxin B; these organelles also compartmentalize aflatoxin. The role of vesicles in aflatoxin biosynthesis and export was confirmed by blocking vesicle-vacuole fusion using 2 independent approaches. Disruption of (encodes a protein homolog of {AvaA}, a small {GTPase} known to regulate vesicle fusion in ) or treatment with Sortin3 (blocks Vps16 function, one protein in the class C tethering complex) increased aflatoxin synthesis and export but did not affect aflatoxin gene expression, demonstrating that vesicles and not vacuoles are primarily involved in toxin synthesis and export. We also observed that development of aflatoxigenic vesicles (aflatoxisomes) is strongly enhanced under aflatoxin-inducing growth conditions. Coordination of aflatoxisome development with aflatoxin gene expression is at least in part mediated by ({VeA}), a global regulator of secondary metabolism. We propose a unique 2-branch model to illustrate the proposed role for {VeA} in regulation of aflatoxisome development and aflatoxin gene expression.},

	abstract = {Pathways and enzymes of fatty acid synthase-mediated, long-even-chain (generally C16-C20) fatty acid synthesis are well studied, and general metabolism involved in short-chain (C4-C7) fatty acid biosynthesis is also understood. In contrast, mechanisms of medium-chain (C8-C14) fatty acid synthesis are unclear. Recent work suggests involvement of chain-elongation-terminating thioesterases in medium-chain fatty acid formation in oilseeds and animals. We have shown that iso- and anteiso-branched and straight, odd- and even-length, short-chain fatty acids esterified in plant-trichome-gland-produced sucrose esters are synthesized by using carbon skeletons provided by modified branched-chain amino acid metabolism/catabolism. The principal enzymes involved are those catalyzing leucine biosynthesis in all organisms and those leading to short-chain alcohols in mutant yeasts and alkyl acids in Clostridium species (products often serving as mammalian pheromones). Here we provide evidence that C10-C12 straight medium-chain and C10-C12 branched medium-chain acyl acids of tomato, C6-C8 straight-chain acyl acids of Petunia, and C6 and C8 branched acyl acids of Nicotiana glutinosa are formed by alpha-ketoacid elongation without participation of fatty acid synthase-mediated reactions or -independent thioesterases. This different metabolism suggests greater integration of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism than previously considered and provides other avenues to study and manipulate not only straight even-length but also odd- and even-length straight and branched medium-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.},

Sequences of three {rDNA} regions, {SSU}, {LSU}, and 5.8S {rDNA}, were generated for 50 helotialean fungi, representing 11 out of 13 families in the current classification. Data sets with different compositions were assembled, and parsimony and Bayesian analyses were performed. The phylogenetic distribution of lifestyle and ecological factors was assessed. Plant endophytism is distributed across multiple clades in the Leotiomycetes. Our results suggest that (1) the inclusion of {LSU} {rDNA} and a wider taxon sampling greatly improves resolution of the Helotiales phylogeny, however, the usefulness of {rDNA} in resolving the deep relationships within the Leotiomycetes is limited; (2) a new class Geoglossomycetes, including Geoglossum, Trichoglossum, and Sarcoleotia, is the basal lineage of the Leotiomyceta; (3) the Leotiomycetes, including the Helotiales, Erysiphales, Cyttariales, Rhytismatales, and Myxotrichaceae, is monophyletic; and (4) nine clades can be recognized within the Helotiales.},

	abstract = {Maytansinoids are potent antitumor agents found in plants and microorganisms. To elucidate their biosynthesis at the biochemical and genetic level and to set the stage for their structure modification through genetic engineering, we have cloned two gene clusters required for the biosynthesis of the maytansinoid, ansamitocin, from a cosmid library of Actinosynnema pretiosum ssp. auranticum {ATCC} 31565. This is a rare case in which the genes involved in the formation of a secondary metabolite are dispersed in separate regions in an Actinomycete. A set of genes, asm22-24, asm43-45, and asm47, was identified for the biosynthesis of the starter unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid ({AHBA}). Remarkably, there are two {AHBA} synthase gene homologues, which may have different functions in {AHBA} formation. Four type I polyketide synthase genes, {asmA}-D, followed by the downloading asm9, together encode eight homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules), each catalyzing a specific round of chain initiation, elongation, or termination steps, which assemble the ansamitocin polyketide backbone. Another set of genes, asm13-17, encodes the formation of an unusual "methoxymalonate" polyketide chain extension unit that, notably, seems to be synthesized on a dedicated acyl carrier protein rather than as a {CoA} thioester. Additional {ORFs} are involved in postsynthetic modifications of the initial polyketide synthase product, which include methylations, an epoxidation, an aromatic chlorination, and the introduction of acyl and carbamoyl groups. Tentative functions of several asm genes were confirmed by inactivation and heterologous expression.},

	shorttitle = {Endophytic fungi},
	abstract = {In the continual search by both pharmaceutical and agricultural industries for new products, natural selection has been found to be superior to combinatorial chemistry for discovering novel substances that have the potential to be developed into new industrial products. Since natural products are adapted to a specific function in nature, the search for novel secondary metabolites should concentrate on organisms that inhabit novel biotopes. Endophytic fungi inhabit such a biotope. In the course of the last 12 years, we have isolated {\textasciitilde} 6500 endophytic fungi from herbaceous plants and trees, screened them for biological activities, and have isolated and determined the structures of the biologically active compounds. Correlations were found between biological activity and biotope, e.g. a higher proportion of the fungal endophytes, in contrast to the soil isolates, inhibited at least one of the test organisms for antialgal and herbicidal activities. The substances isolated originated from different biosynthetic pathways: isoprenoid, polyketide, amino acid derivatives, and belonged to diverse structural groups: terpenoids, steroids, xanthones, chinones, phenols, isocumarines, benzopyranones, tetralones, cytochalasines, and enniatines. The potential role of the endophyte and its biologically active metabolites in its association with its host has been investigated. The fungal endophytes possess the exoenzymes necessary to colonize their hosts and they grow well in the apoplastic washing fluid of the host. When the roots of larch are colonized, the association with the host may be mutualistic, improving growth of the host and supplying the mycobiont with enough nourishment to extensively colonize the host's roots. The concentrations of some plant defence metabolites are lower than in the control when the host is infected with a pathogen than with an endophyte. We hypothesize that the interaction fungal endophyte-plant host is characterized by a finely tuned equilibrium between fungal virulence and plant defence. If this balance is disturbed by either a decrease in plant defence or an increase in fungal virulence, disease develops. Not only must the endophyte synthesize metabolites to compete first with epiphytes and then with pathogens in order to colonize the host, but presumably also to regulate metabolism of the host in their delicately balanced association. The utilization of a biotope such as that of the fungal endophyte is one aspect of intelligent screening, another very important one is the taxonomy of the fungus in order to avoid redundant structural isolations. It is not a random walk through a random forest. Many groups of fungi in different biotopes are waiting to be exploited.},

Assay of pathway enzymes and intermediates indicated that flux through the initial steps catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate synthase and limonene synthase was severely limited by the availability of C(5) isoprenoid precursors in the host. Feeding studies with (-)-limonene, to overcome the flux deficiency, demonstrated the functional capability of limonene-6-hydroxylase and carveol dehydrogenase to produce the end-product carvone; however, uptake and trafficking restrictions greatly compromised the efficiency of these conversions.},

Using the original isolate of M. albus as a selection tool, it has been possible to find other culturally and biochemically unique wild-type isolates of this organism existing as endophytes in a variety of other plant species, including Grevillea pterifolia (fern-leafed grevillea), Kennedia nigriscans (snake vine) and Terminalia prostrata (nanka bakarra) growing in the northern reaches of the Northern Territory of Australia. Interestingly, none of the new isolates had a culture morphology that was identical to the original isolate, nevertheless each possessed hyphal characteristics that resembled that isolate. Furthermore, their {ITS}-5·8S {rDNA} sequences were 96–99 \% identical to that of M. albus and the isolates were considered M. albus on the basis of the {DNA} sequence data. However, the {VOCs} produced by these new isolates greatly differed in quality from the original strain by virtue of the production of naphthalene, naphthalene, 1,1′-oxybis-, and one or more other compounds. In bioassays with a range of test micro-organisms, including fungi and bacteria, each isolate possessed biological activity but the range of activity was great. Artificial mixtures of some of the {VOCs} mimicked the effects of the {VOCs} of the fungus. The value of these observations to the biology and practical uses of M. albus in agriculture and other applications is discussed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:To date, most fungal phylogenies have been derived from single gene comparisons, or from concatenated alignments of a small number of genes. The increase in fungal genome sequencing presents an opportunity to reconstruct evolutionary events using entire genomes. As a tool for future comparative, phylogenomic and phylogenetic studies, we used both supertrees and concatenated alignments to infer relationships between 42 species of fungi for which complete genome sequences are available.{RESULTS}:A dataset of 345,829 genes was extracted from 42 publicly available fungal genomes. Supertree methods were employed to derive phylogenies from 4,805 single gene families. We found that the average consensus supertree method may suffer from long-branch attraction artifacts, while matrix representation with parsimony ({MRP}) appears to be immune from these. A genome phylogeny was also reconstructed from a concatenated alignment of 153 universally distributed orthologs. Our {MRP} supertree and concatenated phylogeny are highly congruent. Within the Ascomycota, the sub-phyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina were resolved. Both phylogenies infer that the Leotiomycetes are the closest sister group to the Sordariomycetes. There is some ambiguity regarding the placement of Stagonospora nodurum, the sole member of the class Dothideomycetes present in the dataset.Within the Saccharomycotina, a monophyletic clade containing organisms that translate {CTG} as serine instead of leucine is evident. There is also strong support for two groups within the {CTG} clade, one containing the fully sexual species Candida lusitaniae, Candida guilliermondii and Debaryomyces hansenii, and the second group containing Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Lodderomyces elongisporus. The second major clade within the Saccharomycotina contains species whose genomes have undergone a whole genome duplication ({WGD}), and their close relatives. We could not confidently resolve whether Candida glabrata or Saccharomyces castellii lies at the base of the {WGD} clade.{CONCLUSION}:We have constructed robust phylogenies for fungi based on whole genome analysis. Overall, our phylogenies provide strong support for the classification of phyla, sub-phyla, classes and orders. We have resolved the relationship of the classes Leotiomyctes and Sordariomycetes, and have identified two classes within the {CTG} clade of the Saccharomycotina that may correlate with sexual status.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The {IUBMB}'s Enzyme Nomenclature system, commonly known as the Enzyme Commission ({EC}) numbers, plays key roles in classifying enzymatic reactions and in linking the enzyme genes or proteins to reactions in metabolic pathways. There are numerous reactions known to be present in various pathways but without any official {EC} numbers, most of which have no hope to be given ones because of the lack of the published articles on enzyme assays.

Results: In this article we propose a new method to predict the potential {EC} numbers to given reactant pairs (substrates and products) or uncharacterized reactions, and a web-server named E-zyme as an application. This technology is based on our original biochemical transformation pattern which we call an ‘{RDM} pattern’, and consists of three steps: (i) graph alignment of a query reactant pair (substrates and products) for computing the query {RDM} pattern, (ii) multi-layered partial template matching by comparing the query {RDM} pattern with template patterns related with known {EC} numbers and (iii) weighted major voting scheme for selecting appropriate {EC} numbers. As the result, cross-validation experiments show that the proposed method achieves both high coverage and high prediction accuracy at a practical level, and consistently outperforms the previous method.

Availability: The E-zyme system is available at http://www.genome.jp/tools/e-zyme/

Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations.

The detergent-solubilized protein binds tetraphenylphosphonium ({TPP}(+)) with a K(D) of 10 {nM}. One mole of ligand is bound per approximately 3 mol of {EmrE}, suggesting that there is one binding site per trimer. The steep {pH} dependence of binding suggests that one or more residues, with an apparent {pK} of approximately 7.5, release protons prior to ligand binding. A conservative Asp replacement (E14D) at position 14 of the only membrane-embedded charged residue shows little transport activity, but binds {TPP}(+) at levels similar to those of the wild-type protein. The apparent {pK} of the Asp shifts to {\textless}5.0. The data are consistent with a mechanism requiring Glu14 for both substrate and proton recognition. We propose a model in which two of the three Glu14s in the postulated trimeric {EmrE} homooligomer deprotonate upon ligand binding.

	abstract = {Multidrug efflux systems display the ability to transport a variety of structurally unrelated drugs from a cell and consequently are capable of conferring resistance to a diverse range of chemotherapeutic agents. This review examines multidrug efflux systems which use the proton motive force to drive drug transport. These proteins are likely to operate as multidrug/proton antiporters and have been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Such proton-dependent multidrug efflux proteins belong to three distinct families or superfamilies of transport proteins: the major facilitator superfamily ({MFS}), the small multidrug resistance ({SMR}) family, and the resistance/ nodulation/cell division ({RND}) family. The {MFS} consists of symporters, antiporters, and uniporters with either 12 or 14 transmembrane-spanning segments ({TMS}), and we show that within the {MFS}, three separate families include various multidrug/proton antiport proteins. The {SMR} family consists of proteins with four {TMS}, and the multidrug efflux proteins within this family are the smallest known secondary transporters. The {RND} family consists of 12-{TMS} transport proteins and includes a number of multidrug efflux proteins with particularly broad substrate specificity. In gram-negative bacteria, some multidrug efflux systems require two auxiliary constituents, which might enable drug transport to occur across both membranes of the cell envelope. These auxiliary constituents belong to the membrane fusion protein and the outer membrane factor families, respectively. This review examines in detail each of the characterized proton-linked multidrug efflux systems. The molecular basis of the broad substrate specificity of these transporters is discussed. The surprisingly wide distribution of multidrug efflux systems and their multiplicity in single organisms, with Escherichia coli, for instance, possessing at least nine proton-dependent multidrug efflux systems with overlapping specificities, is examined. We also discuss whether the normal physiological role of the multidrug efflux systems is to protect the cell from toxic compounds or whether they fulfil primary functions unrelated to drug resistance and only efflux multiple drugs fortuitously or opportunistically.},

Since the sequencing of the first fungus in 1996, the number of available fungal genome sequences has increased by an order of magnitude. Over 40 complete fungal genomes have been publicly released with an equal number currently being sequenced—representing the widest sampling of genomes from any eukaryotic kingdom. Moreover, many of these sequenced species form clusters of related organisms designed to enable comparative studies. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to study the biology and evolution of this medically, industrially, and environmentally important kingdom. In addition, fungi also serve as model organisms for all eukaryotes. The available fungal genomic resource, coupled with the experimental tractability of the fungi, is accelerating research into the fundamental aspects of eukaryotic biology. We provide here an overview of available fungal genomes and highlight some of the biological insights that have been derived through their analysis. We also discuss insights into the fundamental cellular biology shared between fungi and other eukaryotic organisms.},

	abstract = {Beauveria is a globally distributed genus of soil-borne entomopathogenic hyphomycetes of interest as a model system for the study of entomopathogenesis and the biological control of pest insects. Species recognition in Beauveria is difficult due to a lack of taxonomically informative morphology. This has impeded assessment of species diversity in this genus and investigation of their natural history. A gene-genealogical approach was used to investigate molecular phylogenetic diversity of Beauveria and several presumptively related Cordyceps species. Analyses were based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) and elongation factor 1-alpha ({EF}1-alpha) sequences for 86 exemplar isolates from diverse geographic origins, habitats and insect hosts. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum parsimony and Bayesian likelihood methods. Six well supported clades within Beauveria, provisionally designated A-F, were resolved in the {EF}1-alpha and combined gene phylogenies. Beauveria bassiana, a ubiquitous species that is characterized morphologically by globose to subglobose conidia, was determined to be non-monophyletic and consists of two unrelated lineages, clades A and C. Clade A is globally distributed and includes the Asian teleomorph Cordyceps staphylinidaecola and its probable synonym C. bassiana. All isolates contained in Clade C are anamorphic and originate from Europe and North America. Clade B includes isolates of B. brongniartii, a Eurasian species complex characterized by ellipsoidal conidia. Clade D includes B. caledonica and B. vermiconia, which produce cylindrical and comma-shaped conidia, respectively. Clade E, from Asia, includes Beauveria anamorphs and a Cordyceps teleomorph that both produce ellipsoidal conidia. Clade F, the basal branch in the Beauveria phylogeny includes the South American species B. amorpha, which produces cylindrical conidia. Lineage diversity detected within clades A, B and C suggests that prevailing morphological species concepts underestimate species diversity within these groups. Continental endemism of lineages in B. bassiana s.l. (clades A and C) indicates that isolation by distance has been an important factor in the evolutionary diversification of these clades. Permutation tests indicate that host association is essentially random in both B. bassiana s.l. clades A and C, supporting past assumptions that this species is not host specific. In contrast, isolates in clades B and D occurred primarily on coleopteran hosts, although sampling in these clades was insufficient to assess host affliation at lower taxonomic ranks. The phylogenetic placement of Cordyceps staphylinidaecola/bassiana, and C. scarabaeicola within Beauveria corroborates prior reports of these anamorph-teleomorph connections. These results establish a phylogenetic framework for further taxonomic, phylogenetic and comparative biological investigations of Beauveria and their corresponding Cordyceps teleomorphs.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Studies in several plants have shown that Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-{DNA} can integrate into plant chromosomal {DNA} by different mechanisms involving single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) forms. One mechanism requires sequence homology between plant target and {ssT}-{DNA} border sequences and another double-strand-break repair in which preexisting chromosomal {DSBs} “capture” {dsT}-{DNAs}. To learn more about T-{DNA} integration in Solanum lycopersicum we characterised 98 T-{DNA}/plant {DNA} junction sequences and show that T-{DNA} left border ({LB}) and right border transfer is much more variable than previously reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus tremula. The analysis of seven plant target sequences showed that regions of homology between the T-{DNA} {LB} and plant chromosomal {DNA} plays an important role in T-{DNA} integration. One T-{DNA} insertion generated a target sequence duplication that resulted from nucleolytic processing of a {LB}/plant {DNA} heteroduplex that generated a {DSB} in plant chromosomal {DNA}. One broken end contained a captured T-{DNA} that served as a template for {DNA} repair synthesis. We propose that most T-{DNA} integrations in tomato require sequence homology between the {ssT}-{DNA} {LB} and plant target {DNA} which results in the generation of {DSBs} in plant chromosomal {DNA}.},

The structure is very similar to that of the α domains of modern plant terpene cyclases, a result that is of interest since it has been proposed that many plant terpene cyclases may have arisen from bacterial diterpene cyclases. The ent-copalyl diphosphate substrate binds to a hydrophobic pocket near a cluster of Asp and Arg residues that are essential for catalysis, with the carbocations formed on ionization being protected by Leu, Tyr and Phe residues. A bisphosphonate inhibitor binds to the same site. In the kaurene synthase from the moss Physcomitrella patens, 16-α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane as well as kaurene are produced since Leu and Tyr in the P. patens kaurene synthase active site are replaced by smaller residues enabling carbocation quenching by water. Overall, the results represent the first structure determination of a bacterial diterpene cyclase, providing insights into catalytic activity, as well as structural comparisons with diverse terpene synthases and cyclases which clearly separate the terpene cyclases from other terpene synthases having highly α-helical structures.},

	abstract = {Background
The diversity of placental architectures within and among mammalian orders is believed to be the result of adaptive evolution. Although, the genetic basis for these differences is unknown, some may arise from rapidly diverging and lineage-specific genes. Previously, we identified 91 novel lineage-specific transcripts ({LSTs}) from a cow term-placenta {cDNA} library, which are excellent candidates for adaptive placental functions acquired by the ruminant lineage. The aim of the present study was to infer functions of previously uncharacterized lineage-specific genes ({LSGs}) using co-expression, promoter, pathway and network analysis.

Results
Clusters of co-expressed genes preferentially expressed in liver, placenta and thymus were found using 49 previously uncharacterized {LSTs} as seeds. Over-represented composite transcription factor binding sites ({TFBS}) in promoters of clustered {LSGs} and known genes were then identified computationally. Functions were inferred for nine previously uncharacterized {LSGs} using co-expression analysis and pathway analysis tools. Our results predict that these {LSGs} may function in cell signaling, glycerophospholipid/fatty acid metabolism, protein trafficking, regulatory processes in the nucleus, and processes that initiate parturition and immune system development.

Conclusions
The placenta is a rich source of lineage-specific genes that function in the adaptive evolution of placental architecture and functions. We have shown that co-expression, promoter, and gene network analyses are useful methods to infer functions of {LSGs} with heretofore unknown functions. Our results indicate that many {LSGs} are involved in cellular recognition and developmental processes. Furthermore, they provide guidance for experimental approaches to validate the functions of {LSGs} and to study their evolution.},

loci by using inactivation cassettes. In this paper, the ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to genetically transform filamentous fungi was exploited to drive homologous recombination at the trp1 locus of the enthomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. The trp1 disruptants exhibited a clearly distinguishable phenotype from wild-type cells and were recovered with high efficiency of
homologous recombination (22\%). The complementation of such mutants with the wild-type gene generates only transformants with

	abstract = {The activities of integral membrane proteins are often affected by the structures of the lipid molecules that surround them in the membrane. One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure. Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could be important factors in determining the effects of these lipids on protein activities, as well as any effects related to the tendency of the phosphatidylethanolamines to form a curved, hexagonal {HII} phase. Effects of lipid structure on protein aggregation and helix–helix interactions are also discussed, as well as the effects of charged lipids on ion concentrations close to the surface of the bilayer. Interpretations of lipid effects in terms of changes in protein volume, lipid free volume, and curvature frustration are also described. Finally, the role of non-annular, or ‘co-factor’ lipids, tightly bound to membrane proteins, is described.

	abstract = {Microalgae represent an exceptionally diverse but highly specialized group of micro-organisms adapted to various ecological habitats. Many microalgae have the ability to produce substantial amounts (e.g. 20–50\% dry cell weight) of triacylglycerols ({TAG}) as a storage lipid under photo-oxidative stress or other adverse environmental conditions. Fatty acids, the building blocks for {TAGs} and all other cellular lipids, are synthesized in the chloroplast using a single set of enzymes, of which acetyl {CoA} carboxylase ({ACCase}) is key in regulating fatty acid synthesis rates. However, the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis is poorly understood in microalgae. Synthesis and sequestration of {TAG} into cytosolic lipid bodies appear to be a protective mechanism by which algal cells cope with stress conditions, but little is known about regulation of {TAG} formation at the molecular and cellular level. While the concept of using microalgae as an alternative and renewable source of lipid-rich biomass feedstock for biofuels has been explored over the past few decades, a scalable, commercially viable system has yet to emerge. Today, the production of algal oil is primarily confined to high-value specialty oils with nutritional value, rather than commodity oils for biofuel. This review provides a brief summary of the current knowledge on oleaginous algae and their fatty acid and {TAG} biosynthesis, algal model systems and genomic approaches to a better understanding of {TAG} production, and a historical perspective and path forward for microalgae-based biofuel research and commercialization.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Obese and diabetic mice display enhanced intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxaemia that participate in the occurrence of metabolic disorders. Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 ({GLP}-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes.
Methods: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-{CT}) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-{CT} and Ob-Pre mice were treated with {GLP}-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-{CT} mice were treated with a {GLP}-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins {ZO}-1 and occludin ({qPCR} and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation.
Results: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide ({GLP}-2) production whereas the {GLP}-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological {GLP}-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota.
Conclusion: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous {GLP}-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a {GLP}-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa012512},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes.
{METHODS}: We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups.
{RESULTS}: The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.},

Four different fungal species, Aspergillus niger ({AN}), A. ornatus ({AO}), Pencillium chrysogenum ({PC}) and Rhizopus stolonifer ({RS}), commonly reported in moldy tobacco were cultured and screened for {MVOCs}. Because the {MVOCs} emitted by a microbial species are substrate specific, the fungal strains were separately grown on potato dextrose agar ({PDA}) and tobacco products. {MVOCs} from the mold cultures grown on {PDA} and tobacco products were extracted using closed-loop stripping analysis ({CLSA}) and identified by gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry ({GC}/{TOF}-{MS}). Some of the prominent tobacco mold markers identified by this method include: 1-octen-3-ol; 2-octen-1-ol; 2-methyl-1-butanol; 3-methyl-1-butanol; 1-octene and 2-pentanone. In particular, 1-octen-3-ol was detected in all the mold cultures and moldy tobacco samples analyzed. Olfactory evaluation of 1-octen-3-ol indicated a characteristic musty odor and the odor threshold was determined to be approximately 200 ng/ml. The limits of detection for 1-octen-3-ol using {GC}/{TOF}-{MS} and {GC}/mass selective detector ({MSD}) in the full-scan mode and selected ion monitoring ({SIM}) mode were investigated. The {CLSA}-{GC}/{TOF}-{MS} demonstrates a fast, sensitive and semi-quantitative analytical technique for screening tobacco materials for the presence of mold via chemical markers of microbial contamination.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} This study updates previous estimates of the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes and quantifies the increased health resource use and lost productivity associated with diabetes in 2012.
{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} The study uses a prevalence-based approach that combines the demographics of the U.S. population in 2012 with diabetes prevalence, epidemiological data, health care cost, and economic data into a Cost of Diabetes Model. Health resource use and associated medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance coverage, medical condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys, Medicare standard analytical files, and one of the largest claims databases for the commercially insured population in the U.S.
{RESULTS} The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is \$245 billion, including \$176 billion in direct medical costs and \$69 billion in reduced productivity. The largest components of medical expenditures are hospital inpatient care (43\% of the total medical cost), prescription medications to treat the complications of diabetes (18\%), antidiabetic agents and diabetes supplies (12\%), physician office visits (9\%), and nursing/residential facility stays (8\%). People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of about \$13,700 per year, of which about \$7,900 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, care for people with diagnosed diabetes accounts for more than 1 in 5 health care dollars in the U.S., and more than half of that expenditure is directly attributable to diabetes. Indirect costs include increased absenteeism (\$5 billion) and reduced productivity while at work (\$20.8 billion) for the employed population, reduced productivity for those not in the labor force (\$2.7 billion), inability to work as a result of disease-related disability (\$21.6 billion), and lost productive capacity due to early mortality (\$18.5 billion).
{CONCLUSIONS} The estimated total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is \$245 billion, a 41\% increase from our previous estimate of \$174 billion (in 2007 dollars). This estimate highlights the substantial burden that diabetes imposes on society. Additional components of societal burden omitted from our study include intangibles from pain and suffering, resources from care provided by nonpaid caregivers, and the burden associated with undiagnosed diabetes.},

The effect of gene deletions on the flux distributions in the metabolic model of S. cerevisiae was assessed using {OptGene} as the modeling framework and minimization of metabolic adjustments ({MOMA}) as objective function. Deletion of {NADPH}-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by {GDH}1 was identified as the best target gene for the improvement of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in yeast. Deletion of this gene enhances the available {NADPH} in the cytosol for other {NADPH} requiring enzymes, including {HMG}-{CoA} reductase. However, since disruption of {GDH}1 impairs the ammonia utilization, simultaneous over-expression of the {NADH}-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by {GDH}2 was also considered in this study. Deletion of {GDH}1 led to an approximately 85\% increase in the final cubebol titer. However, deletion of this gene also caused a significant decrease in the maximum specific growth rate. Over-expression of {GDH}2 did not show a further effect on the final cubebol titer but this alteration significantly improved the growth rate compared to the {GDH}1 deleted strain.},

	abstract = {Filamentous fungi are the cause of serious human and plant diseases but are also exploited in biotechnology as production platforms. Comparative genomics has documented their genetic diversity, and functional genomics and systems biology approaches are under way to understand the functions and interaction of fungal genes and proteins. In these approaches, gene functions are usually inferred from deletion or overexpression mutants. However, studies at these extreme points give only limited information. Moreover, many overexpression studies use metabolism-dependent promoters, often causing pleiotropic effects and thus limitations in their significance. We therefore established and systematically evaluated a tunable expression system for Aspergillus niger that is independent of carbon and nitrogen metabolism and silent under noninduced conditions. The system consists of two expression modules jointly targeted to a defined genomic locus. One module ensures constitutive expression of the tetracycline-dependent transactivator {rtTA}2S-M2, and one module harbors the {rtTA}2S-M2-dependent promoter that controls expression of the gene of interest (the Tet-on system). We show here that the system is tight, responds within minutes after inducer addition, and allows fine-tuning based on the inducer concentration or gene copy number up to expression levels higher than the expression levels of the {gpdA} promoter. We also validate the Tet-on system for the generation of conditional overexpression mutants and demonstrate its power when combined with a gene deletion approach. Finally, we show that the system is especially suitable when the functions of essential genes must be examined.},

	abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat unit is the most popular locus for species identification and subgeneric phylogenetic inference in sequence-based mycological research. The region is known to show certain variability even within species, although its intraspecific variability is often held to be limited and clearly separated from interspecific variability. The existence of such a divide between intra- and interspecific variability is implicitly assumed by automated approaches to species identification, but whether intraspecific variability indeed is negligible within the fungal kingdom remains contentious. The present study estimates the intraspecific {ITS} variability in all fungi presently available to the mycological community through the international sequence databases. Substantial differences were found within the kingdom, and the results are not easily correlated to the taxonomic affiliation or nutritional mode of the taxa considered. No single unifying yet stringent upper limit for intraspecific variability, such as the canonical 3\% threshold, appears to be applicable with the desired outcome throughout the fungi. Our results caution against simplified approaches to automated {ITS}-based species delimitation and reiterate the need for taxonomic expertise in the translation of sequence data into species names.},

A total of 58 endophytic taxa were recovered using two isolation methods and these were identified based on morphology and {ITS} sequence data. High numbers of leaf endophytes were obtained in the method to determine decomposition of leaves by the natural endophyte community (35 taxa) as compared to disk fragment methodology (9 taxa). The weight loss in A. truncatum leaves decomposed by endophyte communities increased with incubation time; the weight loss was significantly higher at 20 weeks than at 3 and 8 weeks. Both common and rare endophytic taxa produced extracellular enzymes in vitro and showed different leaf decay abilities.

The synthesis of the malonyl-{CoA} building block, catalyzed by acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase (Acc1), is considered a limiting step to achieving high titers of polyketides and fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Acc1 is deactivated by {AMP}-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (Snf1) when glucose is depleted. To prevent this deactivation, the enzyme was aligned with the Rattus norvegicus (rat) Acc1 to identify a critical amino acid (Ser-1157) for phosphorylation and deactivation. Introduction of a S1157A mutation into Acc1 resulted in 9-fold higher specific activity following glucose depletion. The enzyme was tested in yeast engineered to produce the polyketide 6-methylsalisylic acid (6-{MSA}). Both 6-{MSA} and native fatty acid levels increased by 3-fold. Utilization of this modified Acc1 enzyme will also be beneficial for other products built from malonyl-{CoA}. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Overall, we fine-mapped more than 1000 {SVs} and documented that the number of {SVs} among humans is much larger than initially hypothesized; many of the {SVs} potentially affect gene function. The breakpoint junction sequences of more than 200 {SVs} were determined with a novel pooling strategy and computational analysis.

In the past 6 years, significant effort has been expended to reduce the cost by focusing on improving the efficiency of known enzymes, identification of new, more active enzymes, creating enzyme mixes optimized for selected pretreated substrates, and minimization of enzyme production costs.

Alteration or replacement of individual {PKS} modules can lead to the biosynthesis of 'unnatural' natural products but existing techniques for this are time consuming. Here we describe a generic approach to the design of synthetic {PKS} genes where facile cassette assembly and interchange of modules and domains are facilitated by a repeated set of flanking restriction sites. To test the feasibility of this approach, we synthesized 14 modules from eight {PKS} clusters and associated them in 154 bimodular combinations spanning over 1.5-million bp of novel {PKS} gene sequences. Nearly half the combinations successfully mediated the biosynthesis of a polyketide in Escherichia coli, and all individual modules participated in productive bimodular combinations. This work provides a truly combinatorial approach for the production of polyketides.},

	abstract = {Malaria, caused by Plasmodium sp, results in almost one million deaths and over 200 million new infections annually. The World Health Organization has recommended that artemisinin-based combination therapies be used for treatment of malaria. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the plant Artemisia annua. However, the supply and price of artemisinin fluctuate greatly, and an alternative production method would be valuable to increase availability. We describe progress toward the goal of developing a supply of semisynthetic artemisinin based on production of the artemisinin precursor amorpha-4,11-diene by fermentation from engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its chemical conversion to dihydroartemisinic acid, which can be subsequently converted to artemisinin. Previous efforts to produce artemisinin precursors used S. cerevisiae S288C overexpressing selected genes of the mevalonate pathway [Ro et al. (2006) Nature 440:940–943]. We have now overexpressed every enzyme of the mevalonate pathway to {ERG}20 in S. cerevisiae {CEN}.{PK}2, and compared production to {CEN}.{PK}2 engineered identically to the previously engineered S288C strain. Overexpressing every enzyme of the mevalonate pathway doubled artemisinic acid production, however, amorpha-4,11-diene production was 10-fold higher than artemisinic acid. We therefore focused on amorpha-4,11-diene production. Development of fermentation processes for the reengineered {CEN}.{PK}2 amorpha-4,11-diene strain led to production of {\textgreater} 40 g/L product. A chemical process was developed to convert amorpha-4,11-diene to dihydroartemisinic acid, which could subsequently be converted to artemisinin. The strains and procedures described represent a complete process for production of semisynthetic artemisinin.},

A well-known and important member of this family is the polycyclic diterpenoid Taxol (paclitaxel), which promotes tubulin polymerization and shows remarkable efficacy in cancer chemotherapy. The first committed step of Taxol biosynthesis in the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) is the cyclization of the linear isoprenoid substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate ({GGPP}) to form taxa-4(5),11(12)diene, which is catalysed by taxadiene synthase. The full-length form of this diterpene cyclase contains 862 residues, but a roughly 80-residue amino-terminal transit sequence is cleaved on maturation in plastids. We now report the X-ray crystal structure of a truncation variant lacking the transit sequence and an additional 27 residues at the N terminus, hereafter designated {TXS}. Specifically, we have determined structures of {TXS} complexed with 13-aza-13,14-dihydrocopalyl diphosphate (1.82 Å resolution) and 2-fluorogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (2.25 Å resolution). The {TXS} structure reveals a modular assembly of three α-helical domains. The carboxy-terminal catalytic domain is a class I terpenoid cyclase, which binds and activates substrate {GGPP} with a three-metal ion cluster. The N-terminal domain and a third ‘insertion’ domain together adopt the fold of a vestigial class {II} terpenoid cyclase. A class {II} cyclase activates the isoprenoid substrate by protonation instead of ionization, and the {TXS} structure reveals a definitive connection between the two distinct cyclase classes in the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis.},

The method was used to compare metabolite profiles of seven species of fungi grown on two types of sterile agars — potato dextrose and Sabouraud dextrose. Three species from the genus Penicillium (P. italicum, P. camemberti, and P. roqueforti) and four outgroups, each from a different phylum (Saprolegnia sp.; Sordaria fimicola, wild-type; Coprinus cinereus; and Rhizopus stolonifer) were grown on the two types of agars and analyzed.

	abstract = {Fatty acid ethyl esters are secondary metabolites produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and many other fungi. Their natural physiological role is not known but in fermentations of alcoholic beverages and other food products they play a key role as flavor compounds. Information about the metabolic pathways and enzymology of fatty acid ethyl ester biosynthesis, however, is very limited. In this work, we have investigated the role of a three-member S. cerevisiae gene family with moderately divergent sequences ({YBR}177c/{EHT}1, {YPL}095c/{EEB}1, and {YMR}210w). We demonstrate that two family members encode an acyl-{coenzymeA}:ethanol O-acyltransferase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters. Deletion of either one or both of these genes resulted in severely reduced medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester production. Purified glutathione S-transferase-tagged Eht1 and Eeb1 proteins both exhibited acyl-{coenzymeA}:ethanol O-acyltransferase activity in vitro, as well as esterase activity. Overexpression of Eht1 and Eeb1 did not enhance medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester content, which is probably due to the bifunctional synthesis and hydrolysis activity. Molecular modeling of Eht1 and Eeb1 revealed the presence of a alpha/beta-hydrolase fold, which is generally present in the substrate-binding site of esterase enzymes. Hence, our results identify Eht1 and Eeb1 as novel acyl-{coenzymeA}:ethanol O-acyltransferases/esterases, whereas the third family member, Ymr210w, does not seem to play an important role in medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester formation.},

In this work, an Escherichia coli strain that produces 1-butanol and 1-propanol from glucose was constructed. The strain first converts glucose to 2-ketobutyrate, a common keto-acid intermediate for isoleucine biosynthesis. Then, 2-ketobutyrate is converted to 1-propanol through reactions catalyzed by the heterologous decarboxylase and dehydrogenase, or to 1-butanol via the chemistry involved in the synthesis of the unnatural amino acid norvaline. We systematically improved the synthesis of 1-propanol and 1-butanol through deregulation of amino-acid biosynthesis and elimination of competing pathways. The final strain demonstrated a production titer of 2 g/L with nearly 1:1 ratio of butanol and propanol.},

Volatile compound screening of a fungal endophyte collection revealed a number of isolates in the family Xylariaceae, producing a series of terpene molecules including 1,8-cineole. This compound is a commercially important component of eucalyptus oil used in pharmaceutical applications and has been explored as a potential biofuel additive. The genes that produce terpene molecules such as 1,8-cineole have been little explored in fungi, providing an opportunity to explore the biosynthetic origin of these compounds. Through genome sequencing of cineole producing isolate E7406B we were able to identify eleven new terpene synthase genes. Expressing a subset of these genes in E. coli allowed identification of the hyp3 gene, responsible for 1,8-cineole biosynthesis, the first monoterpene synthase discovered in fungi. In a striking example of convergent evolution, mutational analysis of this terpene synthase revealed an active site asparagine critical for water capture and specificity during cineole synthesis, the same mechanism used in an unrelated plant homologue. These studies have provided insight into the evolutionary relationship of fungal terpene synthases to those in plants and bacteria, and further established fungi as a relatively untapped source of this important and diverse class of compounds.},

	abstract = {A soluble delipidized (Na + K)-stimulated {ATPase} was obtained from rabbit kidney outer medulla by the use of sodium deoxycholate. The activity of this enzyme was stimulated 20-fold to an activity of 100 to 120 \{micro\}moles of Pi per mg of protein per hour by either phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol.The effect of the fluidity of the hydrocarbon region of the phospholipid bilayers on this re-activation of (Na + K)-{ATPase} was systematically examined. Fatty acyl chains of known length and varying saturation were substituted on the phosphatidylglycerol moiety and the influence of temperature on the degree of re-activation was investigated. Discontinuities in Arrhenius plots of (Na + K)-{ATPase} activity were found and compared with the gel-to-liquid-crystalline transitions of these substituted phosphatidylglycerols as measured in a differential scanning calorimeter.The temperature at which the Arrhenius plot discontinuities occurred were from 1\{degrees\} to 8\{degrees\} lower than the initial rise of the main endothermic peak for the series: dimyristoyl-, dipalmitoyl-, and distearoylphosphatidylglycerols. Dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol which does not undergo a phase transition within the experimental temperature range was found to activate at much lower concentrations than the saturated phosphatidylglycerols, and the Arrhenius plot did not show discontinuities. In contrast, bovine brain phosphatidylserine with a heterogeneous fatty acyl chain composition showed an Arrhenius plot discontinuity which was 2\{degrees\} higher than the midpoint of the broad endothermic peak.The relation between the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots of the enzyme activity and the lipid phase transitions is discussed. It is suggested that some of the discontinuities represent the completion of melting (upper limit for a broad endothermic transition), whereas others represent the beginning of melting (lower limit). For completely liquid membranes, the slopes of the Arrhenius plots are parallel and give an activation energy of approximately 15 Cal per mole.The influence of membrane fluidity was also studied by examining the effects of cholesterol at constant temperature (37\{degrees\}). In agreement with the above findings, cholesterol, which is known to reduce the fluidity of phospholipid fatty acyl chains, inhibits phospholipid-stimulated (Na + K)-{ATPase} activity. The inhibition is complete, however, only with saturated phospholipids. Partial inhibition is obtained with unsaturated phospholipids.These results are discussed in relation to phase transitions in phospholipid bilayers and biomembranes and the activity of membrane-bound enzymes. A role of cholesterol in controlling the activity of membrane-bound enzymes is suggested. Implications for protein-lipid interactions in membranes are also considered.},

We close or extend 55\% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the human {GRCh}37 reference genome—78\% of which carried long runs of degenerate short tandem repeats, often several kilobases in length, embedded within (G+C)-rich genomic regions. We resolve the complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the base-pair level, including inversions, complex insertions and long tracts of tandem repeats. Most have not been previously reported, with the greatest increases in sensitivity occurring for events less than 5 kilobases in size. Compared to the human reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3:1) in regions corresponding to complex insertions and long short tandem repeats.

This xylariaceaous fungus effectively inhibits and kills certain other fungi, and bacteria, by virtue of a mixture of volatile compounds that it produces. The majority of these compounds were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and then made into an artificial mixture that mimicked the antibiotic effects of the mixture of volatile compounds given off by the fungus. Each of the five classes of volatile compounds produced by the fungus (alcohols, esters, ketones, acids and lipids) had some inhibitory effect against the test fungi and bacteria, but none was lethal. However, collectively they acted synergistically to kill a broad range of plant- and human-pathogenic fungi and bacteria. The most effective class of inhibitory compounds was the esters, of which 1-butanol, 3-methyl-, acetate was the most active biologically.

	abstract = {Microbial communities carry out the majority of the biochemical activity on the planet, and they play integral roles in processes including metabolism and immune homeostasis in the human microbiome. Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes. Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome. We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads. We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy. We subsequently applied this method, {HUMAnN}, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project ({HMP}). This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules. Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome. These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal {pH}) in the posterior fornix. An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann. This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in the {HMP} cohort and in future metagenomic studies.},

	abstract = {Six {DNA} regions were evaluated as potential {DNA} barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal {RNA} cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II}, second largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II}, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low {PCR} amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the {ITS}. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. {ITS} will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

However, ethanol is not an ideal fuel molecule, and lignocellulosic feedstocks are considerably more abundant than both starch and sugar. Thus, many improvements in both the feedstock and the fuel have been proposed. In this paper, we examine the prospects for bioproduction of four second-generation biofuels (n-butanol, 2-butanol, terpenoids, or higher lipids) from four feedstocks (sugars and starches, lignocellulosics, syngas, and atmospheric carbon dioxide). The principal obstacle to commercial production of these fuels is that microbial catalysts of robust yields, productivities, and titers have yet to be developed. Suitable microbial hosts for biofuel production must tolerate process stresses such as end-product toxicity and tolerance to fermentation inhibitors in order to achieve high yields and titers. We tested seven fast-growing host organisms for tolerance to production stresses, and discuss several metabolic engineering strategies for the improvement of biofuels production.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The extent of the enoyl reductase ({ER}) domain was established by detecting similarity to other sequences in the database.

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a {DNA}/{RNA} sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as {BLAST}.

This lack of basic information on taxonomic diversity has significant implications for many aspects of evolutionary biology. While the figure of 1.5 million estimated fungal species is commonly used, critics have questioned the validity of this estimate. Data on biogeographic distributions, levels of endemism, and host specificity must be taken into account when developing estimates of global fungal diversity. This paper introduces a set of papers that attempt to develop a rigorous, minimum estimate of global fungal diversity based on a critical assessment of current species lists and informed predictions of missing data and levels of endemism. As such, these papers represent both a meta-analysis of current data and a gap assessment to indicate where future research efforts should be concentrated.},

	abstract = {Four reactions--chain elongation, cyclopropanation, branching, and cyclobutanation--are used in nature to join isoprenoid units for construction of the carbon skeletons for over 55,000 naturally occurring isoprenoid compounds. Those molecules produced by chain elongation have head-to-tail (regular) carbon skeletons, while those from cyclopropanation, branching, or cyclobutanation have non-head-to-tail (irregular) skeletons. Although wild type enzymes have not been identified for the branching and cyclobutanation reactions, chimeric proteins constructed from farnesyl diphosphate synthase (chain elongation) and chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (cyclopropanation) catalyze all four of the known isoprenoid coupling reactions to give a mixture of geranyl diphosphate (chain elongation), chrysanthemyl diphosphate (cyclopropanation), lavandulyl diphosphate (branching), and maconelliyl and planococcyl diphosphate (cyclobutanation). Replacement of the hydrogen atoms at C1 or C2 or hydrogen atoms in the methyl groups of dimethylallyl diphosphate by deuterium alters the distribution of the cyclopropanation, branching, and cyclobutanation products through primary and secondary kinetic isotope effects on the partitioning steps of common carbocationic intermediates. These experiments establish the sequence in which the intermediates are formed and indicate that enzyme-mediated control of the carbocationic rearrangement and elimination steps determines the distribution of products.},

	abstract = {The type species of Cryptosporella, C. hypodermia, and Ophiovalsa, O. suffusa, as well as closely related species were studied using morphological, cultural, and {DNA} sequence characteristics. {DNA} sequence data from three different loci ({ITS}, {LSU}, and {RPB}2) suggest that C. hypodermia and O. suffusa are congeneric within the Gnomoniaceae (Diaporthales). This result is supported by similarities in perithecial, ascal and ascospore morphology, and lifestyles characterized as initially endophytic, becoming saprobic as plant tissues die. Furthermore, both type species produce Disculina anamorphs. A review of the literature indicates that the generic name Cryptosporella has priority over Ophiovalsa and its synonym Winterella sensu Reid \&amp; Booth (1987). A redescription of the genus Cryptosporella is included, as well as a description of C. hypodermia, C. suffusa, the type species of Ophiovalsa, a brief account of the other seven species accepted in Cryptosporella, and a key to species of Cryptosporella.

In contrast, in drug-sensitive cells, drug-induced specific labeling of membrane proteins with [125I]{INA} was not observed. Instead, multiple membrane proteins became labeled in a nonspecific manner. This phenomenon of drug-induced specigic labeling of P170 by [125I]{INA} is observed only in living cells, but not in purified membrane vesicles or lysed cells. It is generated by doxorubicin and rhodamine 123, drugs that are chromophores and to which the cells exhibit resistance; but it is not observed with other drugs or dyes. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker which reverses resistance to doxorubicin, also abolishes doxorubicin-induced specific [125I]{INA} labeling of P170. These results reveal that a specific interaction between P170 and doxorubicin takes place in living cells and demonstrate that P170 is directly involved in the mechanism of drug resistance in vivo. They also provide a possible means to label functional domains in the multidrug transporter. The results demonstrate that photosensitized [125I]{INA} labeling is a technique which provides sufficient spatial and time resolution to detect specific intracellular interactions between chromophores and proteins in vivo.},

To identify the genome as synthetic, we inserted "watermarks" at intergenic sites known to tolerate transposon insertions. Overlapping "cassettes" of 5 to 7 kilobases (kb), assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, were joined by in vitro recombination to produce intermediate assemblies of approximately 24 kb, 72 kb ("1/8 genome"), and 144 kb ("1/4 genome"), which were all cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes in Escherichia coli. Most of these intermediate clones were sequenced, and clones of all four 1/4 genomes with the correct sequence were identified. The complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, then isolated and sequenced. A clone with the correct sequence was identified.

Endophytes are considered plant mutualists: They receive nutrition and protection from the host plant while the host plant may benefit from enhanced competitive abilities and increased resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and various abiotic stresses. Limited evidence also indicates that endophytes may influence population dynamics, plant community diversity, and ecosystem function. However, most of the empirical evidence for this mutualism and its ecological consequences has been based on a few agronomic grass endophytes. More recent studies suggest that endophyte-host plant interactions are variable and range from antagonistic to mutualistic. A more comprehensive view of the ecology and evolution of endophytes and host plants is needed.

The classification includes 195 taxa, down to the level of order, of which 16 are described or validated here: Dikarya subkingdom nov.; Chytridiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota phyla nov.; Monoblepharidomycetes, Neocallimastigomycetes class. nov.; Eurotiomycetidae, Lecanoromycetidae, Mycocaliciomycetidae subclass. nov.; Acarosporales, Corticiales, Baeomycetales, Candelariales, Gloeophyllales, Melanosporales, Trechisporales, Umbilicariales ords. nov. The clade containing Ascomycota and Basidiomycota is classified as subkingdom Dikarya, reflecting the putative synapomorphy of dikaryotic hyphae. The most dramatic shifts in the classification relative to previous works concern the groups that have traditionally been included in the Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota. The Chytridiomycota is retained in a restricted sense, with Blastocladiomycota and Neocallimastigomycota representing segregate phyla of flagellated Fungi. Taxa traditionally placed in Zygomycota are distributed among Glomeromycota and several subphyla incertae sedis, including Mucoromycotina, Entomophthoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, and Zoopagomycotina. Microsporidia are included in the Fungi, but no further subdivision of the group is proposed. Several genera of 'basal' Fungi of uncertain position are not placed in any higher taxa, including Basidiobolus, Caulochytrium, Olpidium, and Rozella.},

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer by transposition has been widely used for transgenesis in prokaryotes. However, conjugation has been preferred for transfer of large transgenes, despite greater restrictions of host range. We examine the possibility that transposons can be used to deliver large transgenes to heterologous hosts. This possibility is particularly relevant to the expression of large secondary metabolite gene clusters in various heterologous hosts. Recently, we showed that the engineering of large gene clusters like type I polyketide/nonribosomal peptide pathways for heterologous expression is no longer a bottleneck. Here, we apply recombineering to engineer either the epothilone (epo) or myxochromide S ({mchS}) gene cluster for transpositional delivery and expression in heterologous hosts. The 58-kb epo gene cluster was fully reconstituted from two clones by stitching. Then, the epo promoter was exchanged for a promoter active in the heterologous host, followed by engineering into the {MycoMar} transposon. A similar process was applied to the {mchS} gene cluster. The engineered gene clusters were transferred and expressed in the heterologous hosts Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas putida. We achieved the largest transposition yet reported for any system and suggest that delivery by transposon will become the method of choice for delivery of large transgenes, particularly not only for metabolic engineering but also for general transgenesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Unexplained fever ({UF}) is a common problem in children under 3 years old. Although virus infection is suspected to be the cause of most of these fevers, a comprehensive analysis of viruses in samples from children with fever and healthy controls is important for establishing a relationship between viruses and {UF}. We used unbiased, deep sequencing to analyze 176 nasopharyngeal swabs ({NP}) and plasma samples from children with {UF} and afebrile controls, generating an average of 4.6 million sequences per sample. An analysis pipeline was developed to detect viral sequences, which resulted in the identification of sequences from 25 viral genera. These genera included expected pathogens, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and roseoloviruses, plus viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Viruses that were unexpected in {NP} and plasma samples, such as the astrovirus {MLB}-2, were also detected. Sequencing allowed identification of virus subtype for some viruses, including roseoloviruses. Highly sensitive {PCR} assays detected low levels of viruses that were not detected in approximately 5 million sequences, but greater sequencing depth improved sensitivity. On average {NP} and plasma samples from febrile children contained 1.5- to 5-fold more viral sequences, respectively, than samples from afebrile children. Samples from febrile children contained a broader range of viral genera and contained multiple viral genera more frequently than samples from children without fever. Differences between febrile and afebrile groups were most striking in the plasma samples, where detection of viral sequence may be associated with a disseminated infection. These data indicate that virus infection is associated with {UF}. Further studies are important in order to establish the range of viral pathogens associated with fever and to understand of the role of viral infection in fever. Ultimately these studies may improve the medical treatment of children with {UF} by helping avoid antibiotic therapy for children with viral infections.},

We compared the effectiveness of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate ({NBCA}) and traditional suture for patch fixation in Lichtenstein tension-free herniorrhaphy for inguinal hernias.


{METHODS}

A total of 110 patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were assigned randomly to either experimental or control groups. In the experimental group, {NBCA} adhesive was used during Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy; traditional suture was used in the control group. We evaluated operation time, postoperative duration of stay, visual analogue scale ({VAS}) pain score, incidence of chronic pain and hematoma formation, and hernia recurrence.


{RESULTS}

There was no hernia recurrence or wound infection in either group. In the experimental group, 2 local hematomas occurred while no patients experienced chronic postoperative pain; in the control group, 10 hematomas occurred, and 6 patients experienced chronic pain. There was no difference in postoperative duration of stay between the groups (P {\textgreater} .05), but the experimental group had a lesser operation time and postoperative {VAS} score (P {\textless} .05).


{CONCLUSION}

The use of {NBCA} medical adhesive in tension-free inguinal herniorrhaphy is effective and safe.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of {DNA} from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S {rRNA} gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S {rRNA} genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na+(Li+)/H+ antiporter, {RecA}, {DNA} polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Twenty-six Streptomyces spp. were screened for their volatile production capacity on yeast starch agar. The volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) were concentrated on a porous polymer throughout an 8-day growth period. {VOCs} were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and identified or characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 120 {VOCs} were characterized by retention index and mass spectra. Fifty-three compounds were characterized as terpenoid compounds, among which 18 could be identified. Among the {VOCs} were alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, esters, ketones, sulfur compounds, and isoprenoid compounds. Among the most frequently produced compounds were isoprene, acetone, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, cyclopentanone, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, 2-phenylethanol, and geosmin. The relationship between the excretion of geosmin and the production of spores was examined for one isolate. A good correlation between headspace geosmin and the number of spores was observed, suggesting that {VOCs} could be used to indicate the activity of these microorganisms in heterogeneous substrates.

Our findings underscore the substantial functional overlap in the microbiota of individuals when compared to a pool prepared from them, despite the differences observed in certain groups of bacteria detected during the fermentations. In all cases, high levels of acetate were produced followed by n-butyrate and propionate. The averaged cumulative amount of {SCFA} produced in the experiments was 206.3±5.4mmol for the individuals while it was 210.3mmol for the pool. The sequencing analysis showed communities enriched in Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. These results show that the use of a pool of microbiota for in vitro studies does not result in a bacterial community with an aberrant profile and activity compared to that normally obtained from single donors. This demonstrates the suitability of the preparation of a pool of faecal sample to be used for fermentation experiments.},

	abstract = {To identify functionally relevant amino acids in the rat organic cation transporter 1 ({rOCT}1), 18 consecutive amino acids in the presumed fourth transmembrane alpha helix ({TMH}) were mutated and functionally characterized after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. After mutation of three amino acids on successive turns of the alpha helix, K(m) values for tetraethylammonium ({TEA}) and/or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ({MPP}) were decreased. After replacement of Trp218 by tyrosine (W218Y) and Tyr222 by leucine (Y222L), the K(m) values for both {TEA} and {MPP} were decreased. In mutants Y222F and T226A, only the K(m) values for {TEA} and {MPP} were decreased, respectively. The data suggest that amino acids Trp218 and Tyr222 participate in the binding of both {TEA} and {MPP}, whereas Thr226 is only involved in the binding of {MPP}. Using the crystal structure of the lactose permease {LacY} from Escherichia coli that belongs to the same major facilitator superfamily as {rOCT}1, we modeled the tertiary structure of the presumed 12 transmembrane alpha helices. The validity of the model was suggested because seven amino acids that have been shown to participate in the binding of cations by mutagenesis experiments [fourth {TMH} Trp218, Tyr222, and Thr226 (this work); 10th {TMH} Ala443, Leu447, and Gln448 (companion work in this issue of Molecular Pharmacology); 11th {TMH} Asp475 (previous report)] are located in one region surrounding a large cleft that opens to the intracellular side. The dimensions of {TEA} in comparison with the interacting amino acids in the modeled cleft suggest that more than one {TEA} molecule can bind in parallel to the modeled conformation of the transporter.},

	abstract = {A 21-base pair {RNA} duplex that perfectly matches an endogenous target {mRNA} selectively degrades the {mRNA} and suppresses gene expression in mammalian tissue culture cells. A single base mismatch with the target is believed to protect the {mRNA} from degradation, making this type of interference highly specific to the targeted gene. A short {RNA} with mismatches to a target sequence present in multiple copies in the 3'-untranslated region of an exogenously expressed gene can, however, silence it by translational repression. Here we report that a mismatched {RNA}, targeted to a single site in the coding sequence of an endogenous gene, can efficiently silence gene expression by repressing translation. The antisense strand of such a mismatched {RNA} requires a 5'-phosphate but not a 3'-hydroxyl group. G\{middle dot\}U wobble base pairing is tolerated as a match for both {RNA} degradation and translation repression. Together, these findings suggest that a small inhibitory {RNA} duplex can suppress expression of off-target cellular proteins by {RNA} degradation or translation repression. Proper design of experimental small inhibitory {RNAs} or a search for targets of endogenous micro-{RNAs} must therefore take into account that these short {RNAs} can affect expression of cellular genes with as many as 3-4 base mismatches and additional G\{middle dot\}U mismatches.},

However, the link between undiscovered biodiversity and useful products is largely conjectural. Here we provide direct evidence from bioassays of endophytes isolated from tropical plants and bioinformatic analyses that novel biology will indeed yield novel chemistry of potential value.



We isolated and cultured 135 endophytic fungi and bacteria from plants collected in Peru. {nrDNAs} were compared to samples deposited in {GenBank} to ascertain the genetic novelty of cultured specimens. Ten endophytes were found to be as much as 15–30\% different than any sequence in {GenBank}. Phylogenetic trees, using the most similar sequences in {GenBank}, were constructed for each endophyte to measure phylogenetic distance. Assays were also conducted on each cultured endophyte to record bioactivity, of which 65 were found to be bioactive.



The novelty of our contribution is that we have combined bioinformatic analyses that document the diversity found in environmental samples with culturing and bioassays. These results highlight the hidden hyperdiversity of endophytic fungi and the urgent need to explore and conserve hidden microbial diversity. This study also showcases how undergraduate students can obtain data of great scientific significance.},

The use of this approach in combination with large-scale genome sequencing projects has now provided the basis for gaining insight into the function of fungal genes. This chapter reviews the technology of the transformation of filamentous fungi. The protocols for gene transference by protoplasting/{PEG}, {LiAc}, electroporation, biolistics and A. tumefaciens are described, and possible mechanisms for transformation are discussed. A brief description of previously reported selection systems is also included. The application of transforming protocols concerning the study of gene function and manipulation are discussed in relation to some fungal species.},

The stimulation was stereospecific, dose-dependent, and inhibited by the beta-adrenergic agonist propranolol. The addition of {GTP} inside the resealed ghosts shifted the dose-response of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol to the left by 2 orders of magnitude. Direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase [{ATP} pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), {EC} 4.6.1.1] with sodium fluoride or cholera toxin did not increase the methylation of phospholipids. At a concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine that stimulates synthesis of phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine, the activity of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase was increased 2-fold without changes in the basal activity of adenylate cyclase and the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. The increase of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol decreased membrane viscosity and increased translocation of methylated lipids. These findings indicate that enhancement of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol decreases membrane microviscosity and thus increases lateral movement of the beta-adrenergic receptors and coupling with adenylate cyclase.},

	abstract = {The Gnomoniaceae are characterised by ascomata that are generally immersed, solitary, without a stroma, or aggregated with a rudimentary stroma, in herbaceous plant material especially in leaves, twigs or stems, but also in bark or wood. The ascomata are black, soft-textured, thin-walled, and pseudoparenchymatous with one or more central or eccentric necks. The asci usually have a distinct apical ring. The Gnomoniaceae includes species having ascospores that are small, mostly less than 25 μm long, although some are longer, and range in septation from non-septate to one-septate, rarely multi-septate. Molecular studies of the Gnomoniaceae suggest that the traditional classification of genera based on characteristics of the ascomata such as position of the neck and ascospores such as septation have resulted in genera that are not monophyletic. In this paper the concepts of the leaf-inhabiting genera in the Gnomoniaceae are reevaluated using multiple genes, specifically {nrLSU}, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α), and {RNA} polymerase {II} second largest subunit (rpb2) for 64 isolates. {ITS} sequences were generated for 322 isolates. Six genera of leaf-inhabiting Gnomoniaceae are defined based on placement of their type species within the multigene phylogeny. The new monotypic genus Ambarignomonia is established for an unusual species, A. petiolorum. A key to 59 species of leaf-inhabiting Gnomoniaceae is presented and 22 species of Gnomoniaceae are described and illustrated.

Here, we present a comprehensive large-scale analysis of intra-species copy-number variation in the gut microbiome, introducing a rigorous computational pipeline for detecting such variation directly from shotgun metagenomic data. We uncover a large set of variable genes in numerous species and demonstrate that this variation has significant functional and clinically relevant implications. We additionally infer intra-species compositional profiles, identifying population structure shifts and the presence of yet uncharacterized variants.

	abstract = {Fungi produce an impressive array of secondary metabolites ({SMs}) including mycotoxins, antibiotics and pharmaceuticals. The genes responsible for their biosynthesis, export, and transcriptional regulation are often found in contiguous gene clusters. To facilitate annotation of these clusters in sequenced fungal genomes, we developed the web-based software {SMURF} (www.jcvi.org/smurf/) to systematically predict clustered {SM} genes based on their genomic context and domain content. We applied {SMURF} to catalog putative clusters in 27 publicly available fungal genomes.

	abstract = {Background. Invasive aspergillosis ({IA}) remains a leading cause of mortality in immunocompromised patients, in part due to the difficulty of diagnosing this infection.
Methods. Using thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we characterized the in vitro volatile metabolite profile of Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common cause of {IA}, and other pathogenic aspergilli. We prospectively collected breath samples from patients with suspected invasive fungal pneumonia from 2011 to 2013, and assessed whether we could discriminate patients with proven or probable {IA} from patients without aspergillosis, as determined by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group consensus definitions, by direct detection of fungal volatile metabolites in these breath samples.
Results. The monoterpenes camphene, α- and β-pinene, and limonene, and the sesquiterpene compounds α- and β-trans-bergamotene were distinctive volatile metabolites of A. fumigatus in vitro, distinguishing it from other pathogenic aspergilli. Of 64 patients with suspected invasive fungal pneumonia based on host risk factors, clinical symptoms, and radiologic findings, 34 were diagnosed with {IA}, whereas 30 were ultimately diagnosed with other causes of pneumonia, including other invasive mycoses. Detection of α-trans-bergamotene, β-trans-bergamotene, a β-vatirenene–like sesquiterpene, or trans-geranylacetone identified {IA} patients with 94\% sensitivity (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 81\%–98\%) and 93\% specificity (95\% {CI}, 79\%–98\%).
Conclusions. In patients with suspected fungal pneumonia, an Aspergillus secondary metabolite signature in breath can identify individuals with {IA}. These results provide proof-of-concept that direct detection of exogenous fungal metabolites in breath can be used as a novel, noninvasive, pathogen-specific approach to identifying the precise microbial cause of pneumonia.},

In the present study, V. furnissii M1 was subjected to genomic analysis and studied biochemically. The sequence of the 16S {rRNA} gene and repetitive {PCR} showed that V. furnissii M1 was not identical to other V. furnissii strains tested, but the level of relatedness was consistent with its assignment as a V. furnissii strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed chromosomal bands at approximately 3.2 and 1.8 Mb, similar to other Vibrio strains. Complete genomic {DNA} from V. furnissii M1 was sequenced with 21-fold coverage. Alkane biosynthetic and degradation genes could not be identified. Moreover, V. furnissii M1 did not produce demonstrable levels of n-alkanes in vivo or in vitro. In vivo experiments were conducted by growing V. furnissii M1 under different conditions, extracting with solvent, and analyzing extracts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A highly sensitive assay was used for in vitro experiments with cell extracts and [14C]hexadecanol. The data are consistent with the present strain being a V. furnissii with properties similar to those previously described but lacking the alkane-producing phenotype.

There are few substantive methods to measure the health of the immune system, and the connection between immune strength and the viral component of the microbiome is poorly understood. Organ transplant recipients are treated with posttransplant therapies that combine immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs, offering a window into the effects of immune modulation on the virome. We used sequencing of cell-free {DNA} in plasma to investigate drug-virome interactions in a cohort of organ transplant recipients (656 samples, 96 patients) and find that antivirals and immunosuppressants strongly affect the structure of the virome in plasma. We observe marked virome compositional dynamics at the onset of the therapy and find that the total viral load increases with immunosuppression, whereas the bacterial component of the microbiome remains largely unaffected. The data provide insight into the relationship between the human virome, the state of the immune system, and the effects of pharmacological treatment and offer a potential application of the virome state to predict immunocompetence.},

	abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is increasingly recognized as a complex signaling network that impacts on many systems beyond the enteric system modulating, among others, cognitive functions including learning, memory and decision-making processes. This has led to the concept of a microbiota-driven gut-brain axis, reflecting a bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and the intestine. A deficit in synaptic plasticity is one of the many changes that occurs with age. Specifically, the archetypal model of plasticity, long-term potentiation ({LTP}), is reduced in hippocampus of middle-aged and aged rats. Because the intestinal microbiota might change with age, we have investigated whether the age-related deficit in {LTP} might be attenuated by changing the composition of intestinal microbiota with {VSL}\#3, a probiotic mixture comprising 8 Gram-positive bacterial strains. Here, we report that treatment of aged rats with {VSL}\#3 induced a robust change in the composition of intestinal microbiota with an increase in the abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacterioidetes, which was reduced in control-treated aged rats. {VSL}\#3 administration modulated the expression of a large group of genes in brain tissue as assessed by whole gene expression, with evidence of a change in genes that impact on inflammatory and neuronal plasticity processes. The age-related deficit in {LTP} was attenuated in {VSL}\#3-treated aged rats and this was accompanied by a modest decrease in markers of microglial activation and an increase in expression of {BDNF} and synapsin. The data support the notion that intestinal microbiota can be manipulated to positively impact on neuronal function.},

Assembly of reads from single Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus cells captures {\textgreater}91\% of genes within contigs, approaching the 95\% captured from an assembly based on many E. coli cells. We apply this method to assemble a genome from a single cell of an uncultivated {SAR}324 clade of Deltaproteobacteria, a cosmopolitan bacterial lineage in the global ocean. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that {SAR}324 is aerobic, motile and chemotaxic.

Microbial communities associated with seven families and their homes over 6 weeks were assessed, including three families that moved their home. Microbial communities differed substantially among homes, and the home microbiome was largely sourced from humans. The microbiota in each home were identifiable by family. Network analysis identified humans as the primary bacterial vector, and a Bayesian method significantly matched individuals to their dwellings. Draft genomes of potential human pathogens observed on a kitchen counter could be matched to the hands of occupants. After a house move, the microbial community in the new house rapidly converged on the microbial community of the occupants’ former house, suggesting rapid colonization by the family’s microbiota.
Signature microbes follow you from house to house
Householders share more than habitation; they also share inhabitants. In a diverse sample of U.S. homes, Lax et al. found that people and animals sharing homes shared their microbial communities (microbiota) too, probably because of skin shedding and hand and foot contamination. When families moved, their microbiological “aura” followed. If one person left the home even for a few days, their contribution to the microbiome diminished. These findings have implications not only for household identity and composition, but also for indicators of the members' health and well-being.

We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, {pH} 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7\% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger {RNA} expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions.

Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of aristolochene synthase complexed with three Mg2+ ions and the unreactive substrate analogue farnesyl-S-thiolodiphosphate ({FSPP}), showing that the substrate diphosphate group is anchored by metal coordination and hydrogen bond interactions identical to those previously observed in the complex with three Mg2+ ions and inorganic pyrophosphate ({PPi}). Moreover, the binding conformation of {FSPP} directly mimics that expected for productively bound {FPP}, with the exception of the precise alignment of the C?S bond with regard to the C10?C11 π system that would be required for C1?C10 bond formation in the first step of catalysis. We also report crystal structures of aristolochene synthase complexed with Mg2+3-{PPi} and ammonium or iminium analogues of bicyclic carbocation intermediates proposed for the natural cyclization cascade. Various binding orientations are observed for these bicyclic analogues, and these orientations appear to be driven by favorable electrostatic interactions between the positively charged ammonium group of the analogue and the negatively charged {PPi} anion. Surprisingly, the active site is sufficiently flexible to accommodate analogues with partially or completely incorrect stereochemistry. Although this permissiveness in binding is unanticipated, based on the stereochemical precision of catalysis that leads exclusively to the (+)-aristolochene stereoisomer, it suggests the ability of the active site to enable controlled reorientation of intermediates during the cyclization cascade. Taken together, these structures illuminate important aspects of the catalytic mechanism.},

	abstract = {An engineered fusion protein containing two tandem lactose permease molecules (permease dimer) exhibits high transport activity and is used to test the phenomenon of negative dominance. Introduction of the mutation Glu-325--{\textgreater}Cys into either the first or the second half of the dimer results in a 50\% decrease in activity, whereas introduction of the mutation into both halves of the dimer abolishes transport. Lactose transport by permease dimer is completely inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide; however, 40-45\% activity is retained after N-ethylmaleimide treatment when either the first or the second half of the dimer is replaced with a mutant devoid of cysteine residues. The observations demonstrate that both halves of the fusion protein are equally active and suggest that each half may function independently. To test the possibility that oligomerization between dimers might account for the findings, a permease dimer was constructed that contains two different deletion mutants that complement functionally when expressed as untethered molecules. Because this construct does not catalyze lactose transport to any extent whatsoever, it is unlikely that the two halves of the dimer interact or that there is an oligomeric interaction between dimers. The approach is consistent with the contention that the functional unit of lactose permease is a monomer.},

Membrane proteins are mobile in the lipid fluid environment; lateral diffusion of membrane proteins is slower than expected by theory, due to both the effect of protein crowding in the membrane and to constraints from the aqueous matrix. A major aspect of diffusion is in macromolecular associations: reduction of dimensionality for membrane diffusion facilitates collisional encounters, as those concerned with receptor-mediated signal transduction and with electron transfer chains. In mitochondrial electron transfer, diffusional control is prevented by the excess of collisional encounters between fast-diffusing ubiquinone and the respiratory complexes. Another aspect of dynamics of membrane proteins is their conformational flexibility. Lipids may induce the optimal conformation for catalytic activity. Breaks in Arrhenius plots of membrane-bound enzymes may be related to lipid fluidity: the break could occur when a limiting viscosity is reached for catalytic activity. Viscosity can affect protein conformational changes by inhibiting thermal fluctuations to the inner core of the protein molecule.},

Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts significantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protection was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

We sought to determine the efficacy of sutures, human fibrin glue and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate for mesh fixation in patients undergoing the plug and mesh procedure for groin hernia.


{METHODS}

A total of 156 patients with 167 inguinal hernias (11 bilateral) underwent a plug and mesh procedure and were randomly assigned to received either sutures (n = 59 hernias), human fibrin glue (n = 52) or N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (n = 56) for mesh fixation.


{RESULTS}

The overall morbidity rate was 38.98\% in the suture group, 9.62\% in the fibrin glue group and 10.71\% in the N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group (suture v. fibrin glue, p {\textless} 0.001; suture v. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, p {\textless} 0.001). There was no significant difference in morbidity between the fibrin glue and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate groups. Overall, short-term morbidity was significantly higher in the suture group (27.12\%) than in the fibrin glue (9.62\%, p = 0.01) or N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (8.93\%, p = 0.004) groups, but there was no significant difference between the fibrin glue and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of mean postoperative stay (32.6 h in the suture group v. 30.8 h in the fibrin glue group v. 32.0 h in the N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group) or mean time to return to work (20.4 d in the suture group v. 20.3 d in the fibrin glue group v. 19.8 d in the N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group). Overall, long-term morbidity was significantly higher in the suture group (11.86\%) than in the fibrin glue (0\%, p = 0.001) or N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (1.78\%, p = 0.03) groups. There was no recurrence in any of the groups. Two cases (3.39\%) of chronic groin pain were reported in patients in the suture group. A sensation of extraneous body was reported in 5 (8.47\%) patients who received sutures and in 1 (1.78\%) patient in the N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate group; there were no reported cases in the fibrin glue group (suture v. fibrin glue, p = 0.01; suture v. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, p = 0.03; fibrin glue v. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, p = 0.30).


{CONCLUSION}

The use of human fibrin glue or N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is better tolerated than sutures in tension-free inguinal open repair using the plug and mesh technique in terms of overall immediate results, and there is a better trend in the long-term data.},

Using an inactive mutant ({MdfA}-E26T), we isolated a spontaneous second-site mutation ({MdfA}-E26T/V335E) that re-established the recognition of cationic drugs by the transporter. Only a negative charge at position 335 was able to restore the functioning of the inactive mutant {MdfA}-E26T. Intriguingly, the two genetically interacting residues are located at remote and distinct regions along the secondary structure of {MdfA}. Glu-26 is located in the periplasmic half of transmembrane helix 1, and as shown here, the complementing charge at position 335 resides within the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices 10 and 11. The spatial relation between the two residues was investigated by cross-linking. A functional split version of {MdfA} devoid of cysteines was constructed and introduced with a cysteine pair at positions 26 and 335. Strikingly, the results indicate that residues 26 and 335 are spatially adjacent, suggesting that they both constitute parts of the multidrug recognition pocket of {MdfA}. The fact that electrostatic interactions are preserved with cationic substrates even if the critical acidic residue is placed on another face of the pocket reveals an additional dimension of promiscuity in multidrug recognition and transport.},

The Ascocoryne strains did not produce highly branched medium-chain-length alkanes, and efforts to reproduce the branched alkane production of {NRRL} 50072 were unsuccessful. However, we confirmed the production of 30 other products and expanded the list of {VOCs} for {NRRL} 50072 and members of the genus Ascocoryne. {VOCs} detected from the cultures consisted of short- and medium-chain alkenes, ketones, esters and alcohols and several sesquiterpenes. Ascocoryne strains {NRRL} 50072 and {CBS} 309.71 produced a more diverse range of volatiles than the other isolates tested. {CBS} 309.71 also showed enhanced production compared with other strains when grown on cellulose agar. Collectively, the members of the genus Ascocoryne demonstrated production of over 100 individual compounds, with a third of the short- and medium-chain compounds also produced when cultures were grown on a cellulose substrate. This comparative production analysis could facilitate future studies to identify and manipulate the biosynthetic machinery responsible for production of individual {VOCs}, including several that have a potential application as biofuels.},

	abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.

These effects are suggested to be due to the interactions between the phospholipids and the skin lipid bilayers, and so an in vitro method was developed to evaluate the influence of phospholipids on the distribution of drugs to stratum corneum lipids. The distribution coefficients of estradiol, progesterone and propranolol between stratum corneum lipid liposomes ({SCLLs}) without phospholipids or with {EPC}, {DSPC}, {SPC} (-[alpha]-phosphatidylcholine from soybean) or {DOPE} (dioleylphosphatidyl ethanolamine), and {pH} 7.4 buffer were determined. Fluid-state phospholipids in {SCLLs} increased the partitioning of drugs into {SCLLs}, while gel-state lipid, {DSPC}, did not. The increased distribution of drugs into the {SCLLs} was at least partially due to the increased fluidity of {SCLL} bilayers by phospholipids, which was shown using steady-state fluorescence anisotropy. This in vitro method enables screening of the effects of phospholipids and other permeation enhancers on stratum corneum bilayer fluidity and drug partitioning.},

	abstract = {To date, there is rapidly increasing evidence for host–microbe interaction at virtually all levels of complexity, ranging from direct cell-to-cell communication to extensive systemic signalling, and involving various organs and organ systems, including the central nervous system. As such, the discovery that differential microbial composition is associated with alterations in behaviour and cognition has significantly contributed to establishing the microbiota–gut–brain axis as an extension of the well-accepted gut–brain axis concept. Many efforts have been focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. There is also a growing appreciation of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping brain and behaviour. However, the role of epigenetics in informing host–microbe interactions has received little attention to date. This is despite the fact that there are many plausible routes of interaction between epigenetic mechanisms and the host-microbiota dialogue. From this new perspective we put forward novel, yet testable, hypotheses. Firstly, we suggest that gut-microbial products can affect chromatin plasticity within their host's brain that in turn leads to changes in neuronal transcription and eventually alters host behaviour. Secondly, we argue that the microbiota is an important mediator of gene-environment interactions. Finally, we reason that the microbiota itself may be viewed as an epigenetic entity. In conclusion, the fields of (neuro)epigenetics and microbiology are converging at many levels and more interdisciplinary studies are necessary to unravel the full range of this interaction.},

In addition, they are excellent models for molecular and genetic studies. An important key in the advancement of genetics and molecular biology of a given organism is the development of genetic transformation systems. This technology makes possible the analysis and manipulation of the genome of the organism of interest. Thirty years from the first report of transformation of a fungus, transformation of many other fungi has been achieved. However, the development of gene tagging systems generally applicable to a wide range of filamentous fungi has remained elusive. A widely used gene tagging strategy for filamentous fungi is restriction enzyme mediated integration ({REMI}). In recent years numerous reports have been published describing the effective application of {REMI}. However, {REMI} shows certain disadvantages for some fungi. Recently a very promising alternative strategy has been reported based on the use of the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Using this system a well-defined {DNA} segment (T-{DNA}) is transferred, which integrates by illegitimate recombination and is 100-1000 times more efficient than conventional methods. The T-{DNA} can be used as an efficient tool to generate recombinant strains where {DNA} is integrated as a single copy, allowing the generation of collections of gene-tagged mutants of the fungus of interest.},

	doi = {10.1128/mBio.00323-10},
	abstract = {Hydrogen gas (H2) is a possible future transportation fuel that can be produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria via nitrogenase. The electrons for H2 are usually derived from organic compounds. Thus, one would expect more H2 to be produced when anoxygenic phototrophs are supplied with increasingly reduced (electron-rich) organic compounds. However, the H2 yield does not always differ according to the substrate oxidation state. To understand other factors that influence the H2 yield, we determined metabolic fluxes in Rhodopseudomonas palustris grown on 13C-labeled fumarate, succinate, acetate, and butyrate (in order from most oxidized to most reduced). The flux maps revealed that the H2 yield was influenced by two main factors in addition to substrate oxidation state. The first factor was the route that a substrate took to biosynthetic precursors. For example, succinate took a different route to acetyl-coenzyme A ({CoA}) than acetate. As a result, R. palustris generated similar amounts of reducing equivalents and similar amounts of H2 from both succinate and acetate, even though succinate is more oxidized than acetate. The second factor affecting the H2 yield was the amount of Calvin cycle flux competing for electrons. When nitrogenase was active, electrons were diverted away from the Calvin cycle towards H2, but to various extents, depending on the substrate. When Calvin cycle flux was blocked, the H2 yield increased during growth on all substrates. In general, this increase in H2 yield could be predicted from the initial Calvin cycle flux.{IMPORTANCE} Photoheterotrophic bacteria, like Rhodopseudomonas palustris, obtain energy from light and carbon from organic compounds during anaerobic growth. Cells can naturally produce the biofuel H2 as a way of disposing of excess electrons. Unexpectedly, feeding cells organic compounds with more electrons does not necessarily result in more H2. Despite repeated observations over the last 40 years, the reasons for this discrepancy have remained unclear. In this paper, we identified two metabolic factors that influence the H2 yield, (i) the route taken to make biosynthetic precursors and (ii) the amount of {CO}2-fixing Calvin cycle flux that competes against H2 production for electrons. We show that the H2 yield can be improved on all substrates by using a strain that is incapable of Calvin cycle flux. We also contributed quantitative knowledge to the long-standing question of why photoheterotrophs must produce H2 or fix {CO}2 even on relatively oxidized substrates.},

Production of these compounds in microbial hosts, such as Escherichia coli, can be limited by intracellular levels of the polyprenyl diphosphate precursors, geranyl diphosphate ({GPP}), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate ({GGPP}). To alleviate this limitation, we constructed synthetic operons that express three key enzymes for biosynthesis of these precursors: (1) {DXS},1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; (2) {IPPHp}, {IPP} isomerase from Haematococcus pluvialis; and (3) one of two variants of {IspA}, {FPP} synthase that produces either {GPP} or {GGPP}. The reporter plasmids {pAC}-{LYC} and {pACYC}-{IB}, which encode enzymes that convert either {FPP} or {GGPP}, respectively, to the pigment lycopene, were used to demonstrate that at full induction, the operon encoding the wild-type {FPP} synthase and mutant {GGPP} synthase produced similar levels of lycopene. To synthesize di- or monoterpenes in E. coli using the {GGPP} and {GPP} encoding operons either a diterpene cyclase [casbene cyclase (Ricinus communis L) and ent-kaurene cyclase (Phaeosphaeria sp. L487)] or a monoterpene cyclase [3-carene cyclase (Picea abies)] was coexpressed with their respective precursor production operon.

	abstract = {The healthy microbiota show remarkable variability within and among individuals. In addition to external exposures, ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this variation. It is thus of interest to assess what relationships might exist among microbes and determine their underlying reasons. The initial Human Microbiome Project ({HMP}) cohort, comprising 239 individuals and 18 different microbial habitats, provides an unprecedented resource to detect, catalog, and analyze such relationships. Here, we applied an ensemble method based on multiple similarity measures in combination with generalized boosted linear models ({GBLMs}) to taxonomic marker (16S {rRNA} gene) profiles of this cohort, resulting in a global network of 3,005 significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between 197 clades occurring throughout the human microbiome. This network revealed strong niche specialization, with most microbial associations occurring within body sites and a number of accompanying inter-body site relationships. Microbial communities within the oropharynx grouped into three distinct habitats, which themselves showed no direct influence on the composition of the gut microbiota. Conversely, niches such as the vagina demonstrated little to no decomposition into region-specific interactions. Diverse mechanisms underlay individual interactions, with some such as the co-exclusion of Porphyromonaceae family members and Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque supported by known biochemical dependencies. These differences varied among broad phylogenetic groups as well, with the Bacilli and Fusobacteria, for example, both enriched for exclusion of taxa from other clades. Comparing phylogenetic versus functional similarities among bacteria, we show that dominant commensal taxa (such as Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides in the gut) often compete, while potential pathogens (e.g. Treponema and Prevotella in the dental plaque) are more likely to co-occur in complementary niches. This approach thus serves to open new opportunities for future targeted mechanistic studies of the microbial ecology of the human microbiome.},

Biosynthesis of this fascinating scaffold is catalyzed in part by an unusual iterative type I polyketide synthase, {PKSE}, that is shared among all enediyne biosynthetic pathways whose gene clusters have been sequenced to date. The {PKSE} is unusual in two main respects: (1) it contains an acyl carrier protein ({ACP}) domain with no sequence homology to any known proteins, and (2) it is self-phosphopantetheinylated by an integrated phosphopantetheinyl transferase ({PPTase}) domain. The unusual domain architecture and biochemistry of the {PKSE} hold promise both for the rapid identification of new enediyne natural products and for obtaining fundamental catalytic insights into enediyne biosynthesis. This chapter describes methods for rapid {PCR}-based classification of conserved enediyne biosynthetic genes, heterologous production of 9-membered {PKSE} proteins and isolation of the resulting polyene product, and in vitro characterization of the {PKSE} {ACP} domain.},

	abstract = {Many theoretical advances have been made in applying probabilistic inference methods to improve the power of sequence homology searches, yet the {BLAST} suite of programs is still the workhorse for most of the field. The main reason for this is practical: {BLAST}'s programs are about 100-fold faster than the fastest competing implementations of probabilistic inference methods. I describe recent work on the {HMMER} software suite for protein sequence analysis, which implements probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim in {HMMER}3 is to achieve {BLAST}'s speed while further improving the power of probabilistic inference based methods. {HMMER}3 implements a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these improvements synergize. {HMMER}3 uses more powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory; it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed comparable to {BLAST}. The {HMMER} project aims to usher in a new generation of more powerful homology search tools based on probabilistic inference methods.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The filamentous fungus, Aspergillus niger, responds to nutrient availability by modulating secretion of various substrate degrading hydrolases. This ability has made it an important organism in industrial production of secreted glycoproteins. The recent publication of the A. niger genome sequence and availability of microarrays allow high resolution studies of transcriptional regulation of basal cellular processes, like those of glycoprotein synthesis and secretion. It is known that the activities of certain secretory pathway enzymes involved N-glycosylation are elevated in response to carbon source induced secretion of the glycoprotein glucoamylase. We have investigated whether carbon source dependent enhancement of protein secretion can lead to upregulation of secretory pathway elements extending beyond those involved in N-glycosylation. {RESULTS}: This study compares the physiology and transcriptome of A. niger growing at the same specific growth rate (0.16 h(-1)) on xylose or maltose in carbon-limited chemostat cultures. Transcription profiles were obtained using Affymetrix {GeneChip} analysis of six replicate cultures for each of the two growth-limiting carbon sources. The production rate of extracellular proteins per gram dry mycelium was about three times higher on maltose compared to xylose. The defined culture conditions resulted in high reproducibility, discriminating even low-fold differences in transcription, which is characteristic of genes encoding basal cellular functions. This included elements in the secretory pathway and central metabolic pathways. Increased protein secretion on maltose was accompanied by induced transcription of {\textgreater} 90 genes related to protein secretion. The upregulated genes encode key elements in protein translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}), folding, N-glycosylation, quality control, and vesicle packaging and transport between {ER} and Golgi. The induction effect of maltose resembles the unfolded protein response ({UPR}), which results from {ER}-stress and has previously been defined by treatment with chemicals interfering with folding of glycoproteins or by expression of heterologous proteins. {CONCLUSION}: We show that upregulation of secretory pathway genes also occurs in conditions inducing secretion of endogenous glycoproteins - representing a more normal physiological state. Transcriptional regulation of protein synthesis and secretory pathway genes may thus reflect a general mechanism for modulation of secretion capacity in response to the conditional need for extracellular enzymes.},

	abstract = {It is now certain that the inherent ethanol tolerance of the Saccharomyces strain used is not the prime factor regulating the level of ethanol that can be produced in a high sugar brewing, wine, sake, or distillery fermentation. In fact, in terms of the maximum concentration that these yeasts can produce under batch (16 to 17\% [v/v]) or fed-batch conditions, there is clearly no difference in ethanol tolerance. This is not to say, however, that under defined conditions there is no difference in ethanol tolerance among different Saccharomyces yeasts. This property, although a genetic determinant, is clearly influenced by many factors (carbohydrate level, wort nutrition, temperature, osmotic pressure/water activity, and substrate concentration), and each yeast strain reacts to each factor differently. This will indeed lead to differences in measured tolerance. Thus, it is extremely important that each of these be taken into consideration when determining "tolerance" for a particular set of fermentation conditions. The manner in which each alcohol-related industry has evolved is now known to have played a major role in determining traditional thinking on ethanol tolerance in Saccharomyces yeasts. It is interesting to speculate on how different our thinking on ethanol tolerance would be today if sake fermentations had not evolved with successive mashing and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of rice carbohydrate, if distillers' worts were clarified prior to fermentation but brewers' wort were not, and if grape skins with their associated unsaturated lipids had not been an integral part of red wine musts. The time is now ripe for ethanol-related industries to take advantage of these findings to improve the economies of production. In the authors' opinion, breweries could produce higher alcohol beers if oxygenation (leading to unsaturated lipids) and "usable" nitrogen source levels were increased in high gravity worts. White wine fermentations could also, if desired, match the higher ethanol levels in red wines if oxygenation (to provide the unsaturated lipids deleted in part by the removal of the grape skins) were practiced and if care were given to assimilable nitrogen concentrations. This would hold true even at 10 to 14 degrees C, and the more rapid fermentations would maximize utilization of winery tankage.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Branched-chain fatty acids ({BCFAs}) are important precursors for the production of advanced biofuels with improved cold-flow properties. Previous efforts in engineering type {II} fatty acid synthase ({FAS}) for {BCFA} production suffered from low titers and/or the co-production of a large amount of straight-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}), making it nearly impossible for further conversion of {BCFAs} to branched biofuels. Synthesis of both {SCFAs} and {BCFAs} requires {FabH}, the only β-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase in Escherichia coli that catalyzes the initial condensation reaction between malonyl-{ACP} and a short-chain acyl-{CoA}. In this study, we demonstrated that replacement of the acetyl-{CoA}-specific E. coli {FabH} with a branched-chain-acyl-{CoA}-specific {FabH} directed the flux to the synthesis of {BCFAs}, resulting in a significant enhancement in {BCFA} titer compared to a strain containing both acetyl-{CoA}- and branched-chain-acyl-{CoA}-specific {FabHs}. We further demonstrated that the composition of {BCFAs} can be tuned by engineering the upstream pathway to control the supply of different branched-chain acyl-{CoAs}, leading to the production either even-chain-iso-, odd-chain-iso-, or odd-chain-anteiso-{BCFAs} separately. Overall, the top-performing strain from this study produced {BCFAs} at 126 mg/L, comprising 52\% of the total free fatty acids. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;9999: 1–10. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Both factors contribute to a competitive advantage of organisms in ecosystems. All organisms have evolved active transport mechanisms by which endogenous and exogenous toxicants can be secreted. Two major classes of transporter proteins are the {ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) and the major facilitator superfamily ({MFS}) transporters. Members of both classes can have broad and overlapping substrate specificities for natural toxic compounds and can be regarded as a "first-line defense barrier" in survival mechanisms. In plant pathogens, these transporters can play an essential role in protection against plant defense compounds during pathogenesis. Also, some transporters actively secrete host-specific and non-host-specific toxins. Remarkably, {ABC} and {MFS} transporters can also play a major role in fungicide sensitivity and resistance. Their role in multidrug resistance of Aspergillus nidulans, Candida albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to azoles and other fungitoxic compounds is well established. Knowledge of {ABC} and {MFS} transporters opens possibilities of developing novel strategies for controlling plant diseases, either by modulation of transporter activity or by transgenic expression of transporter genes in plants.},

	abstract = {Endoscopic hernia repair methods have become increasingly popular over the past 15 years. The postulated main advantages of the endoscopic technique are less postoperative pain, early recovery and lower recurrence rates. Fixation of the endoscopic mesh seems to be necessary to minimize the risk of recurrence. Stapling has been implicated to cause chronic inguinal pain syndromes. We performed a retrospective study on male patients who were endoscopically operated on primary inguinal hernias. Our aim was to clarify whether mesh fixation using a fibrin sealant is as safe and reliable as conventional stapling. Additionally, we compared the prevalence of chronic inguinal pain. A standardized population of 133 male patients (mean age 55.9 years) with 186 (80 unilateral; 53 bilateral) consecutive primary laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repairs was assigned to two groups, depending on whether stapling or a fibrin sealant had been used for mesh fixation. A retrospective case control study was performed to conduct statistical analysis based on the following parameters: recurrence, complications, chronic inguinal pain, foreign body sensation and numbness. Hernia repairs numbering 173 (staples n=87; fibrin n=86) were followed up for a mean duration of 23.7 (11-47) months. The prevalence of chronic inguinal pain was significantly (P=0.002; Fisher exact test) higher in the stapled group-20.7\% than in the fibrin sealant group with a prevalence of 4.7\%. In terms of recurrence rate, complications and foreign body sensation, fewer patients were affected in the fibrin group than in the reference population, although the differences were not statistically significant. There were no major complications in either of the groups. The mean postoperative stay in hospital was 1.4 days. Fibrin sealing is as effective as stapling in providing secure mesh fixation. The fibrin group displayed a statistically significant lower prevalence of chronic pain syndromes. Mesh sealing provides adequate fixation and reduces the risk of chronic inguinal pain as a complication of the intervention.},

Human iron deficiency that is nevertheless highly prevalent in developing regions of the world, can be effectively treated by oral iron administration.

The chemical properties of iron, the luminal environment and host iron withdrawal mechanisms, especially during inflammation, can turn the intestine in a rather stressful milieu. Certain pathogenic enteric bacteria can however deal with this stress at the expense of other members of the gut microbiota, while their virulence also seems to be stimulated in an iron-rich intestinal environment. This review covers the multifaceted aspects of nutritional iron stress with respect to growth, composition, metabolism and pathogenicity of the gut microbiota in relation to human health.

Nature has been a source of medicinal products for millennia, with many useful drugs developed from plant sources. Following discovery of the penicillins, drug discovery from microbial sources occurred and diving techniques in the 1970s opened the seas. Combinatorial chemistry (late 1980s), shifted the focus of drug discovery efforts from Nature to the laboratory bench. Scope of Review
This review traces natural products drug discovery, outlining important drugs from natural sources that revolutionized treatment of serious diseases. It is clear Nature will continue to be a major source of new structural leads, and effective drug development depends on multidisciplinary collaborations. Major Conclusions
The explosion of genetic information led not only to novel screens, but the genetic techniques permitted the implementation of combinatorial biosynthetic technology and genome mining. The knowledge gained has allowed unknown molecules to be identified. These novel bioactive structures can be optimized by using combinatorial chemistry generating new drug candidates for many diseases. General Significance
The advent of genetic techniques that permitted the isolation / expression of biosynthetic cassettes from microbes may well be the new frontier for natural products lead discovery. It is now apparent that biodiversity may be much greater in those organisms. The numbers of potential species involved in the microbial world are many orders of magnitude greater than those of plants and multi-celled animals. Coupling these numbers to the number of currently unexpressed biosynthetic clusters now identified (\&gt; 10 per species) the potential of microbial diversity remains essentially untapped.},

	abstract = {Membrane fluidity plays an important role in cell function and may, in many instances, be adjusted to facilitate specific cellular processes. To understand better the effect that lipid chemistry has on membrane fluidity the inclusion of three different lipids into egg phosphatidylcholine ({eggPC}) bilayers has been examined; the three lipids are egg phosphatidylethanolamine (({eggPE}) made by transphosphatidylation of {eggPC} in the presence of ethanolamine), lyso-phosphatidylcholine ({LPC}), and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine ({LPE}). The fluidity of the membranes was determined using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and the intermolecular interactions were examined using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was observed that both headgroup and tail chemistry can significantly modulate lipid diffusion. Specifically, the inclusion of {LPC} and {eggPE} significantly altered the lipid diffusion, increased and decreased, respectively, whereas the inclusion of {LPE} had an intermediate effect, a slight decrease in diffusion. Strong evidence for the formation of hydrogen-bonds between the phosphate group and the amine group in {eggPE} and {LPE} was observed with infrared spectroscopy. The biological implications of these results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Many compounds being considered as candidates for advanced biofuels are toxic to microorganisms. This introduces an undesirable trade-off when engineering metabolic pathways for biofuel production because the engineered microbes must balance production against survival. Cellular export systems, such as efflux pumps, provide a direct mechanism for reducing biofuel toxicity. To identify novel biofuel pumps, we used bioinformatics to generate a list of all efflux pumps from sequenced bacterial genomes and prioritized a subset of targets for cloning. The resulting library of 43 pumps was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, where we tested it against seven representative biofuels. By using a competitive growth assay, we efficiently distinguished pumps that improved survival. For two of the fuels (n-butanol and isopentanol), none of the pumps improved tolerance. For all other fuels, we identified pumps that restored growth in the presence of biofuel. We then tested a beneficial pump directly in a production strain and demonstrated that it improved biofuel yields. Our findings introduce new tools for engineering production strains and utilize the increasingly large database of sequenced genomes.},

We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a ?natural product mimic? or ?{NM}? to join the original primary divisions and have added a new designation, ?natural product botanical? or ?{NB}?, to cover those botanical ?defined mixtures? that have now been recognized as drug entities by the {FDA} and similar organizations. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from around the 1940s to date, of the 175 small molecules, 131, or 74.8\%, are other than ?S? (synthetic), with 85, or 48.6\%, actually being either natural products or directly derived therefrom. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, with, as expected from prior information, the anti-infective area being dependent on natural products and their structures. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have been used very successfully in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 30-year time frame. We wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the ?host from whence it was isolated?, and therefore we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.},

The {ATMT} results in higher transformation efficiencies than previously available polyethylene glycol-mediated protocols, and falcate spores can be used instead of protoplasts for transformation. Various experimental parameters were tested for their effects on transformation efficiencies. The parameters with the greatest influence were the A. tumefaciens strain used and the Ti-plasmid it carried, the ratio of bacterium to fungus during cocultivation, and the length of cocultivation. Southern analysis demonstrated that most transformants (80\%) contained tandem integrations of plasmid sequences, and at least 36\% had integrations at multiple sites in the genome. In a majority of cases (70\%), the whole Ti-plasmid, and not just the T-{DNA}, had integrated as a series of tandem repeats. Tandem integrations, especially of the whole plasmid, make it difficult to rescue {DNA} from both flanks of the integrations with standard {PCR}-based approaches. Thus, {ATMT} may be unsuitable for insertional mutagenesis of C. graminicola without further modification.},

	abstract = {Zearalenone is a mycotoxin with estrogenic effects on mammals that is produced by several species of Fusarium. We found that zearalenone and its derivatives inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi on solid media at concentrations of [≤]10 \{micro\}g/ml. The fungitoxic effect declined in the order zearalenone {\textgreater} \{alpha\}-zearalenol {\textgreater} \{beta\}-zearalenol. The mycoparasitic fungus Gliocladium roseum produces a zearalenone-specific lactonase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of zearalenone, followed by a spontaneous decarboxylation. The growth of G. roseum was not inhibited by zearalenone, and the lactonase may protect G. roseum from the toxic effects of this mycotoxin. We inactivated zes2, the gene encoding zearalenone lactonase in G. roseum, by inserting a hygromycin resistance cassette into the coding sequence of the gene by means of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation. The zes2 disruption mutants could not hydrolyze the lactone bond of zearalenone and were more sensitive to zearalenone. These data are consistent with a hypothesis that resorcylic acid lactones exemplified by zearalenone act to reduce growth competition by preventing competing fungi from colonizing substrates occupied by zearalenone producers and suggest that they may play a role in fungal defense against mycoparasites.},

As an example, this organism produced an extensive series of the acetic acid esters of straight-chained alkanes including those of pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, sec-octyl and decyl alcohols. Other hydrocarbons were also produced by this organism, including undecane, 2,6-dimethyl; decane, 3,3,5-trimethyl; cyclohexene, 4-methyl; decane, 3,3,6-trimethyl; and undecane, 4,4-dimethyl. Volatile hydrocarbons were also produced on a cellulose-based medium, including heptane, octane, benzene, and some branched hydrocarbons. An extract of the host plant, Eucryphia cordifolia (ulmo), supported the growth and hydrocarbon production of this fungus. Quantification of volatile organic compounds, as measured by proton transfer mass spectrometry ({PTR}-{MS}), indicated a level of organic substances in the order of 80 p.p.m.v. (parts per million by volume) in the air space above the oatmeal agar medium in an 18 day old culture. Scaling the {PTR}-{MS} profile the acetic acid heptyl ester was quantified (at 500 p.p.b.v.) and subsequently the amount of each compound in the {GC}/{MS} profile could be estimated; all yielded a total value of about 4.0 p.p.m.v. The hydrocarbon profile of G. roseum contains a number of compounds normally associated with diesel fuel and so the volatiles of this fungus have been dubbed myco-diesel'. Extraction of liquid cultures of the fungus revealed the presence of numerous fatty acids and other lipids. All of these findings have implications in energy production and utilization.},

We have studied alkene biosynthesis in Micrococcus luteus {ATCC} 4698, a close relative of Sarcina lutea (now Kocuria rhizophila), which 4 decades ago was reported to biosynthesize iso- and anteiso-branched, long-chain alkenes. The underlying biochemistry and genetics of alkene biosynthesis were not elucidated in those studies. We show here that heterologous expression of a three-gene cluster from M. luteus (Mlut\_13230-13250) in a fatty acid-overproducing Escherichia coli strain resulted in production of long-chain alkenes, predominantly 27:3 and 29:3 (no. carbon atoms: no.

Heterologous expression of Mlut\_13230 ({oleA}) alone produced no long-chain alkenes but unsaturated aliphatic monoketones, predominantly 27:2, and in vitro studies with the purified Mlut\_13230 protein and tetradecanoyl-coenzyme A ({CoA}) produced the same C27 monoketone. Gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed the elemental composition of all detected long-chain alkenes and monoketones (putative intermediates of alkene biosynthesis). Negative controls demonstrated that the M. luteus genes were responsible for production of these metabolites. Studies with wild-type M. luteus showed that the transcript copy number of Mlut\_13230-13250 and the concentrations of 29:1 alkene isomers (the dominant alkenes produced by this strain) generally corresponded with bacterial population over time. We propose a metabolic pathway for alkene biosynthesis starting with acyl-{CoA} (or-{ACP} [acyl carrier protein]) thioesters and involving decarboxylative Claisen condensation as a key step, which we believe is catalyzed by {OleA}. Such activity is consistent with our data and with the homology (including the conserved Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad) of Mlut\_13230 ({OleA}) to {FabH} (β-ketoacyl-{ACP} synthase {III}), which catalyzes decarboxylative Claisen condensation during fatty acid biosynthesis.},

Obtaining a set of well-characterized genes is a basic requirement in the initial steps of any genome annotation process. An accurate set of genes is needed in order to learn about species-specific properties, to train gene-finding programs, and to validate automatic predictions. Unfortunately, many new genome projects lack comprehensive experimental data to derive a reliable initial set of genes.Results: In this study, we report a computational method, {CEGMA} (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach), for building a highly reliable set of gene annotations in the absence of experimental data. We define a set of conserved protein families that occur in a wide range of eukaryotes, and present a mapping procedure that accurately identifies their exon–intron structures in a novel genomic sequence. {CEGMA} includes the use of profile-hidden Markov models to ensure the reliability of the gene structures. Our procedure allows one to build an initial set of reliable gene annotations in potentially any eukaryotic genome, even those in draft stages.Availability: Software and data sets are available online at http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Datasets.Contact: ifkorf@ucdavis.{eduSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In this review, we describe secondary metabolites produced by fungi that act as sporogenic factors to influence fungal development, are required for spore viability, or are produced at a time in the life cycle that coincides with development. We describe environmental and genetic factors that can influence the production of secondary metabolites. In the case of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, we review the only described work that genetically links the sporulation of this fungus to the production of the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin through a shared G-protein signaling pathway.},

Kinetic analysis of Hoechst 33342 transport in inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis showed that the {LmrP}-mediated H(+)/Hoechst 33342 antiport reaction obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a low apparent affinity constant of 0.63 {microM} Hoechst 33342 (= 0.5 mmol Hoechst 33342/mol phospholipid). Several drugs significantly inhibited {LmrP}-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport through a direct interaction with the protein rather than through dissipation of the proton motive force or reduction of the membrane partitioning of Hoechst 33342. The characterization of the mechanism of inhibition of {LmrP}-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport indicated competitive inhibition by quinine and verapamil, noncompetitive inhibition by nicardipin and vinblastin, and uncompetitive inhibition by {TPP}(+). The three types of inhibition of {LmrP}-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport in inside-out membrane vesicles indicate for the first time the presence of multiple drug interaction sites in a secondary multidrug transporter.},

This direct approach provides a quantitative view of genome-wide polyadenylation states in a strand-specific manner and requires only attomole {RNA} quantities. The polyadenylation profiles revealed an abundance of unannotated polyadenylation sites, alternative polyadenylation patterns, and regulatory element-associated poly(A)+ {RNAs}. We observed differences in sequence composition surrounding canonical and noncanonical human polyadenylation sites, suggesting novel noncoding {RNA}-specific polyadenylation mechanisms in humans. Furthermore, we observed the correlation level between sense and antisense transcripts to depend on gene expression levels, supporting the view that overlapping transcription from opposite strands may play a regulatory role.

	abstract = {A microbroth kinetic model based on turbidity measurements was developed in order to analyze the growth characteristics of three species of filamentous fungi (Rhizopus microsporus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Scedosporium prolificans) characterized by different growth rates in five nutrient media (antibiotic medium 3, yeast nitrogen base medium, Sabouraud broth, {RPMI} 1640 alone, and {RPMI} 1640 with 2\% glucose). In general, five distinct phases in the growth of filamentous fungi could be distinguished, namely, the lag phase, the first transition period, the log phase, the second transition period, and the stationary phase. The growth curves were smooth and were characterized by the presence of long transition periods. Among the different growth phases distinguished, the smallest variability in growth rates among the strains of each species was found during the log phase in all nutrient media. The different growth phases of filamentous fungi were barely distinguishable in {RPMI} 1640, in which the poorest growth was observed for all fungi even when the medium was supplemented with 2\% glucose. R. microsporus and A. fumigatus grew better in Sabouraud and yeast nitrogen base medium than in {RPMI} 1640, with growth rates three to four times higher. None of the media provided optimal growth of S. prolificans. The germination of Rhizopus spores and Aspergillus and Scedosporium conidia commenced after 2 and 5 h of incubation, respectively. The elongation rates ranged from 39.6 to 26.7, 25.4 to 20.2, and 16.9 to 9.9 \{micro\}m/h for Rhizopus, Aspergillus, and Scedoporium hyphae, respectively. The germination of conidia and spores and the elongation rates of hyphae were enhanced in antibiotic medium 3 and delayed in yeast nitrogen base medium. In conclusion, the growth curves provide a useful tool to gain insight into the growth characteristics of filamentous fungi in different nutrient media and may help to optimize the methodology for antifungal susceptibility testing.},

A new tool, {BLAT}, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for {mRNA}/{DNA} alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. {BLAT}'s speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the {RAM} of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. {BLAT} has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, {BLAT} revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how {BLAT} was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. {BLAT} is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based {BLAT} server for the human genome.},

This industrially important filamentous fungus is slow-growing, is very darkly pigmented, and has not been easy to manipulate genetically. Using a {PCR} strategy to survey the G. lozoyensis genome for polyketide synthase ({PKS}) genes, we have identified pks1, a gene that consists of five exons interrupted by four introns of 56, 400, 50 and 341 bp. It encodes a 2124-amino acid protein with five catalytic modules: ketosynthase, acyltransferase, two acyl carrier sites, and thioesterase/Claisen cyclase. The transcriptional initiation and termination sites were found 43 bp upstream of the translational start codon and 295 bp downstream of the translational stop codon, respectively. Cluster analysis of 37 fungal ketosynthase modules grouped the Pks1p with {PKSs} involved in the biosynthesis of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin. Disruption of pks1 yielded knockout mutants that displayed an albino phenotype, suggesting that pks1 encodes a tetrahydroxynaphthalene synthase. Gene replacement was achieved by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which proved to be simple and efficient. Loss of pigmentation occurred in more than half the transformants, and examination of six non-pigmented transformants showed that the functional genomic copy of the pks1 gene had been replaced by the disruption cassette in each case. A putative 1215-bp {ORF} (dsg) devoid of introns was present downstream from pks1. {BLAST} analysis of the 405-amino acid sequence of its predicted product showed a high degree of similarity with Zn({II})2Cys6 binuclear cluster {DNA}-binding proteins, a class of fungal transcription factors involved in the regulation of polyketide production and other pathways.},

	abstract = {The Escherichia coli multidrug transporter {MdfA} contains a membrane-embedded charged residue (Glu-26) that was shown to play an important role in substrate recognition. To identify additional determinants of multidrug recognition we isolated 58 intragenic second-site mutations that restored the function of inactive {MdfA} E26X mutants. In addition, two single-site mutations that enhanced the activity of wild-type {MdfA} were identified. Most of the mutations were found in two regions, the cytoplasmic half of transmembrane segments ({TMs}) 4, 5, and 6 (cluster 1) and the periplasmic half of {TM} 1 and 2 (cluster 2). The identified residues were mutated to cysteines in the background of a functional cysteine-less {MdfA}, and substrate protection against alkylation was analyzed. The results support the suggestion that the two clusters are involved in substrate recognition. Using inverted membrane vesicles we observed that a proton electrochemical gradient (\{Delta\}[{IMG}]f1.gif" {BORDER}="0"{\textgreater}mu;H+, inside positive and acidic) enhanced the substrate-protective effect in the cytoplasmic region, whereas it largely reduced this effect in the periplasmic side of {MdfA}. Therefore, we propose that substrates interact with two sites in {MdfA}, one in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane and the other in the periplasmic leaflet. Theoretically, these domains could constitute a large part of the multidrug pathway through {MdfA}.},

	abstract = {Terpene synthases are responsible for the biosynthesis of the complex chemical defense arsenal of plants and microorganisms. How do these enzymes, which all appear to share a common terpene synthase fold, specify the many different products made almost entirely from one of only three substrates? Elucidation of the structure of 1,8-cineole synthase from Salvia fruticosa (Sf-{CinS}1) combined with analysis of functional and phylogenetic relationships of enzymes within Salvia species identified active-site residues responsible for product specificity. Thus, Sf-{CinS}1 was successfully converted to a sabinene synthase with a minimum number of rationally predicted substitutions, while identification of the Asn side chain essential for water activation introduced 1,8-cineole and alpha-terpineol activity to Salvia pomifera sabinene synthase. A major contribution to product specificity in Sf-{CinS}1 appears to come from a local deformation within one of the helices forming the active site. This deformation is observed in all other mono- or sesquiterpene structures available, pointing to a conserved mechanism. Moreover, a single amino acid substitution enlarged the active-site cavity enough to accommodate the larger farnesyl pyrophosphate substrate and led to the efficient synthesis of sesquiterpenes, while alternate single substitutions of this critical amino acid yielded five additional terpene synthases.},

Here, we present the first analysis and optimization of these effects for selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing ({SHAPE}-Seq). We first optimize {SHAPE}-Seq, and show that it provides highly reproducible reactivity data over a wide range of {RNA} structural contexts with no apparent biases. As part of this optimization, we present {SHAPE}-Seq v2.0, a ‘universal’ method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide of an {RNA} without having to use or introduce a specific reverse transcriptase priming site within the {RNA}. We show that {SHAPE}-Seq v2.0 is highly reproducible, with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in {RNA} folding algorithms to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other {SHAPE} methods. We anticipate {SHAPE}-Seq v2.0 to be broadly applicable to understanding the {RNA} sequence–structure relationship at the heart of some of life's most fundamental processes.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of 16S {rRNA} sequences through next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial community composition and structure. One common approach in using these data to explore the genetic diversity in a microbial community is to cluster the 16S {rRNA} sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units ({OTUs}) based on sequence similarities. The inferred {OTUs} can then be used to estimate species, diversity, composition, and richness. Although a number of methods have been developed and commonly used to cluster the sequences into {OTUs}, relatively little guidance is available on their relative performance and the choice of key parameters for each method. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten existing {OTU} inference methods. We found that the appropriate dissimilarity value for defining distinct {OTUs} is not only related with a specific method but also related with the sample complexity. For data sets with low complexity, all the algorithms need a higher dissimilarity threshold to define {OTUs}. Some methods, such as, {CROP} and {SLP}, are more robust to the specific choice of the threshold than other methods, especially for shorter reads. For high-complexity data sets, hierarchical cluster methods need a more strict dissimilarity threshold to define {OTUs} because the commonly used dissimilarity threshold of 3\% often leads to an under-estimation of the number of {OTUs}. In general, hierarchical clustering methods perform better at lower dissimilarity thresholds. Our results show that sequence abundance plays an important role in {OTU} inference. We conclude that care is needed to choose both a threshold for dissimilarity and abundance for {OTU} inference.},

We expanded on previously published protocols by constructing a system that enables retrieval and characterization of the metagenomic {DNA} from biologically active clones. To test the functionality of these methods, we constructed and screened two metagenomic libraries in S. lividans. One was constructed with pooled {DNA} from 14 bacterial isolates cultured from Alaskan soil and the second with {DNA} directly extracted from the same soil. Functional screening of these libraries identified numerous clones with hemolytic activity, one clone that produces melanin by a previously unknown mechanism, and one that induces the overproduction of a secondary metabolite native to S. lividans. All bioactive clones were functional in S. lividans but not in E. coli, demonstrating the advantages of screening metagenomic libraries in more than one host.},

Pyrosequencing generated approximately 40,000 16S {rRNA} gene sequences per sample and allowed the identification of 17 phyla in soil samples under Cerrado vegetation. Acidobacteria were dominant in all areas studied with a relative frequency of 40-47 \%, followed closely by Proteobacteria accounting for 34-40 \% of the sequences.

	abstract = {Planar bilayer membranes containing functional acetylcholine receptor were formed from vesicles of Torpedo marmorata electric organ without extracting the acetylcholine receptor from its native environment. Native vesicles were transformed into monolayers which subsequently were apposed into planar bilayers. In the absence of agonists the membrane conductance was similar to that of lipid bilayers. Addition of carbamoylcholine or succinylcholine caused increased membrane conductance and this could be competitively inhibited by d-tubocurarine and suppressed by alpha-bungarotoxin. The amplitude of the conductance response was proportional to the number of alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites in the bilayers. Asymmetric membranes could be formed with the ligand binding sites on only one membrane surface. Desensitization of acetylcholine receptor was evident from equilibrium and kinetic data of the carbamoylcholine-activated conductance. Carbamoylcholine-induced membrane permeability was about 7 times higher for K+ and Na+ ions than for Cl-. At low levels of conductance, single-channel fluctuations of 20-25 {pS} in conductance and 1.3-msec lifetime were resolved in physiological saline containing carbamoylcholine. The ratio of observed channels to alpha-bungarotoxin sites present showed that a significant fraction of acetylcholine receptor in the membrane was functional. The quantitative aspects of the cation channel, the desensitization, and the ligand binding properties were in close agreement with established values. This transformation of natural acetylcholine receptor vesicles to planar bilayers conserves the essential properties of the in vivo receptor.},

	abstract = {An endophytic fungus was isolated that produces a series of volatile natural products, including terpenes and odd chain polyenes. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolate using five loci suggests that it is closely related to Nigrograna mackinnonii {CBS} 674.75. The main component of the polyene series was purified and identified as (3E,5E,7E)-nona-1,3,5,7-tetraene ({NTE}), a novel natural product. Non-oxygenated hydrocarbons of this chain length are uncommon and desirable as gasoline-surrogate biofuels. The biosynthetic pathway for {NTE} production was explored using metabolic labeling and gas chromatography time of flight mass spectometer ({GCMS}). Two-carbon incorporation 13C acetate suggests that it is derived from a polyketide synthase ({PKS}) followed by decarboxylation. There are several known mechanisms for such decarboxylation, though none have been discovered in fungi. Towards identifying the {PKS} responsible for the production of {NTE}, the genome of N. mackinnonii E5202H ({ATCC} {SD}-6839) was sequenced and assembled. Of the 32 {PKSs} present in the genome, 17 are predicted to contain sufficient domains for the production of {NTE}. These results exemplify the capacity of endophytic fungi to produce novel natural products that may have many uses, such as biologically derived fuels and commodity chemicals.},

These metabolic changes correlated with changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and transfer of the gut microbiota from {TLR}5-deficient mice to wild-type germ-free mice conferred many features of metabolic syndrome to the recipients. Food restriction prevented obesity, but not insulin resistance, in the {TLR}5-deficient mice.

Recent technological advances are enabling unprecedentedly detailed studies of the dynamics of the microbiota in animal models and human populations. This review will highlight key areas of investigation in the field, including establishment of the microbiota during early childhood, temporal variability of the microbiome in healthy adults, responses of the microbiota to intentional perturbations such as antibiotics and dietary changes, and prospective analyses linking changes in the microbiota to host disease status.

We have determined its crystal structure, which illuminates how this enzyme is initially activated and then carries out multiple steps of synthesis in each of six sterically isolated reaction chambers. Six of the catalytic sites are in the wall of the assembly facing an acyl carrier protein ({ACP}) bound to the ketoacyl synthase domain. Two-dimensional diffusion of substrates to the catalytic sites may be achieved by the electrostatically negative {ACP} swinging to each of the six electrostatically positive catalytic sites. The phosphopantetheinyl transferase domain lies outside the shell of the assembly, inaccessible to {ACP} that lies inside, suggesting that the attachment of the pantetheine arm to {ACP} must occur before complete assembly of the complex. Author Keywords: {PROTEINS}   The de novo synthesis of fatty acids is carried out by fatty acid synthase ({FAS}), which catalyzes cycles of multistep chemical reactions that are essentially the same in all organisms. {FAS} uses one acetyl-coenzyme A ({CoA}) and seven malonyl-{CoA} molecules to synthesize the 16-carbon palmitic acid, the most abundant fatty acid in eukaryotes (Lynen, 1980) (Figure 1A). Despite the conserved reaction mechanisms, {FAS} systems are remarkably diverse and are divided into two types based on the organization of their catalytic units. Type I {FASs} are highly integrated multienzymes that contain all catalytic activities of the cyclic reaction as discrete domains on a single polypeptide chain (α) or on two different polypeptides (α and β). Type I {FASs} are further divided into two subgroups. The first subgroup is the animal {FAS} that is active as α2 homodimers (Smith et al., 2003). The second, microbial, subgroup comprises some bacterial type I {FASs}, which are α6 hexamers, and fungal {FASs}, which are α6β6 dodecamers (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004). Bacterial, plant, and mitochondrial {FASs} belong to the type {II} {FAS} systems, the components of which, in contrast to the type I, are small independent proteins. Each protein usually catalyzes a single step of the multistep cyclic reaction (White et al., 2005). Yeast {FAS}, a member of the fungal type I {FAS} family, contains six copies of eight independent functional domains in an α6β6 molecular complex of 2.6 {MDa}. Each of the α and β subunits contains four functional domains ([Fichtlscherer et al., 2000] and [Mohamed et al., 1988]) (Figure 1A). These eight functional domains catalyze all reactions required for synthesis of fatty acids in yeast: activation, priming, multiple cycles of elongation, and termination. All these reactions occur in a limited space inside the α6β6 complex (Lynen, 1980). The activation of yeast {FAS} is achieved by its phosphopantetheinyl transferase ({PPT}) domain located at the C terminus of the α subunit (Fichtlscherer et al., 2000). {PPT} attaches the 18 Å 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (pantetheine arm) of {CoA} to the acyl carrier protein ({ACP}) domain that is positioned at the N terminus of the α subunit (Figure 1A, reaction 1). {ACP} plays a central role in the entire synthesis process by shuttling among the catalytic centers of the {FAS} complex all of the substrate intermediates that remain covalently linked to the {SH} terminus of the pantetheine arm. The location of {PPT} and {ACP} on the same polypeptide chain is a unique feature of yeast {FAS} (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004). The amino acid sequence of yeast {PPT} has a low degree of similarity with those of other phosphopantetheinyl transferases (Lambalot et al., 1996). The priming reaction is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase ({AT}) domain located close to the N terminus of the β subunit. {AT} initiates fatty acid synthesis by loading the acetate primer from acetyl-{CoA} onto the {SH} group of the {ACP} pantetheine arm (Figure 1A, reaction 2). A unique characteristic of yeast {FAS} is the existence of a separate {AT} domain that has exclusive specificity for the priming substrate, acetyl-{CoA}, and discriminates against the elongation substrate, malonyl-{CoA} (Schuster et al., 1995). In contrast, animal type I {FAS} multienzymes use the same malonyl/acetyltransferase domain to load either the priming or the elongating substrate onto {ACP} (Smith et al., 2003). In bacterial type {II} {FAS} systems, the acetate primer is directly transferred from acetyl-{CoA} to the enzyme β-ketoacyl-{ACP} synthase {III} ({FabH}) that catalyzes the first condensation reaction in the chain elongation cycle (White et al., 2005). Elongation cycles begin when {ACP} delivers the acetate primer to the active-site cysteine on the ketoacyl synthase ({KS}) domain located in the α subunit (Figure 1A, reaction 3). Subsequently, the empty {ACP} moves to the malonyl transacylase ({MPT}) domain located at the C terminus of the β subunit in order to acquire the malonyl group of the elongation substrate, malonyl-{CoA} (Figure 1A, reaction 4). {ACP} then delivers the bound malonate back to the {KS} domain for chain elongation. {KS} condenses its bound acyl group with the {ACP}-bound malonate to a 3-ketoacyl intermediate (Figure 1A, reaction 5). This two-carbon-longer 3-ketoacyl intermediate is then processed sequentially three times to produce the saturated fatty acid (Figure 1A, reactions 6–8). The ketoacyl reductase ({KR}) domain in the α subunit catalyzes the first step of substrate reduction, followed by a dehydration reaction catalyzed by the dehydratase ({DH}) domain in the β subunit. A second reduction reaction is catalyzed next by the enoyl reductase ({ER}) domain in the β subunit. {ACP} shuttles the reaction intermediates between active centers during processing and subsequently brings the processed acyl chain back to the {KS} domain for the next cycle of elongation (Figure 1A, reaction 3). Termination occurs when the length of the fatty acid chain reaches 16 or 18 carbons. The product, palmitic or stearic acid, is delivered by {ACP} from {ER} to the active center of {MPT}, where it is transferred to the {SH} group of {CoA} and then released (Figure 1A, reaction 9). This reaction is the second reaction catalyzed by {MPT}, which is therefore a malonyl/palmitoyl transacylase that catalyzes both the transfer of elongation substrates and the transfer of the final product (Lynen, 1980). Perhaps the most striking feature of fungal {FAS} is its high degree of architectural complexity, in which 48 functional centers exist in a single α6β6 particle. Detailed structural information is essential for delineating how this complex particle coordinates the reactions involved in many steps of synthesis of fatty acids. The structures of fungal {FAS} have been studied by immunoelectron microscopy (Wieland et al., 1978), single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Kolodziej et al., 1996), and X-ray crystallography (Jenni et al., 2006). These studies show that the α6β6 fungal {FAS} forms a barrel-shaped hollow body separated at the equator by a wheel-like structure with three spokes. The 5 Å-resolution X-ray electron density map further allowed the placement of the known structures of the homologous bacterial enzymes that catalyze individual steps of the cyclic reactions, except for {ACP} and {PPT} (Jenni et al., 2006). We have now determined the atomic structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {FAS} derived from two crystal forms of the enzyme that were obtained by a fortuitous accident. While attempting to crystallize the yeast 40S ribosomal subunit, we obtained instead these crystals of {FAS}, which cosediments at 40S with the small ribosomal subunit. Though the electron density maps are at only modestly high resolution (4 Å), their quality is superb due to 9-fold noncrystallographic averaging, thereby allowing us to enhance the visibility of side-chain electron density through sharpening to trace the entire polypeptide backbone (minus a few disordered regions) for both chains and to position 50\% of the protein side chains. In contrast to the previous structural studies of fungal {FAS} (Jenni et al., 2006), we have now been able to observe that the {ACP} resides within the particle chamber, while unexpectedly, the activating {PPT} domain is observed to lie outside of the particle. The six α subunits form a central wheel in the assembly, and the β subunits form domes on the top and bottom of the wheel, creating six reaction chambers within which each {ACP} can reach the six active sites through surprisingly modest movements. This structure now provides a complete framework for understanding the structural basis of this macromolecular machine's important function. The crystal structure of the yeast S. cerevisiae fatty acid synthase was determined at 4 Å resolution from two crystal forms with space groups P21 and P43212, respectively (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Initial phases were obtained by the molecular replacement method using the Cα coordinates of homologous domains that were previously placed in a low-resolution map of fungal {FAS} (Protein Data Bank {ID} code 2CDH) (Jenni et al., 2006). Despite the fact that these Cα atoms represent less than 5\% of the total mass of the {FAS} particle, the model-based phases were dramatically improved by interactive cycles of 9-fold noncrystallographic averaging in the two crystal forms. The final electron density map is of exceptional quality, uncharacteristic of its 4 Å resolution, as judged by the appearance of electron density for many side chains (Figures 1B–1D). This allowed us to build with confidence a model that contains main-chain backbones for 1687 aa (out of 1887 aa) of the α subunit and all of the β subunit, as well as about 50\% of the amino acid side chains. Our model of the 2.6 {MDa} α6β6 fatty acid synthase (Figure 2A; Movie S1) comprises all of the eight catalytic domains that are required for fatty acid synthesis, including {ACP} and {PPT}, which were previously unobserved (Jenni et al., 2006) (Figure 2C). {ACP} is located inside the hollow particle and presumably moves within a limited space, which we call the reaction chamber. The active sites of the catalytic domains that are required for priming, elongation, and termination are embedded in the chamber walls facing inward. As a consequence of their spatial arrangement, only one unique set of six catalytic centers is accessed by a particular {ACP} domain. The overall interior of the {FAS} particle therefore contains six separate reaction chambers. Interestingly, the {PPT} domains, which activate {ACP}, lie outside the particle and are inaccessible to {ACP} because they are on the opposite side of the particle wall. The external position of the {PPT} domain has profound implications for the {FAS} activation mechanism and the assembly of the {FAS} particle, as described in the Discussion. The complex architecture of the {FAS} particle is maintained by structural domains and linkers that make up about half of the molecule (Figure 2B). These domains provide the framework that holds the particle together and orients the catalytic domains. Their sizes and complexity range from a simple loop or helix to large domain structures with distinctive folds. We used the Dali server (Holm and Park, 2000) to search for proteins that have structures similar to these domains and found none. They consequentially represent new folds and may have evolved independently to tether and orient the multiple active centers of fungal {FAS} for efficient catalysis. The barrel-shaped {FAS} particle is separated into two halves by a wheel-like structure at the equator formed by the α subunits (Figure 2C). This central wheel consists exclusively of six α subunits and has a point-group symmetry of 32 (D3). The dome is formed by a trimer of β subunits that lie on each side of the α subunit wheel (Figure 2D). The two β trimers do not interact with each other and are only held together by interactions with the α subunits on the equator. The particle is 270 Å long and 230 Å wide at the equator, and its width tapers to 160 Å at the end of the barrel. The overall smooth exterior surface of the {FAS} particle is disrupted at the equator by three pairs of 30 Å protuberances (Figures 2A and 2C), each of which is composed of two {PPT} domains. The α subunit of yeast {FAS} is composed of four functional domains and two structural domains ({SDα}) that are positioned in the sequence in the following order: {ACP}, {SD}1α, {KR}, {KS}, {SD}2α, and {PPT} (Figure 3A). The catalytic domains are located at the “rim” and the protuberance of the central wheel, while the structural domains form the central scaffold that contains the “axle,” the “hub,” and the “spoke” of the wheel (Figure 2E). The central player in the reaction of fatty acid synthesis—{ACP}—lies at the N terminus of domain 1 (residues 137–305) and is located above the hub of the wheel inside the {FAS} reaction chamber (Figure 2C and Figure 3B). This domain is composed of eight α helices and is divided into two subdomains. The {ACP} subdomain (residues 147–217) lies close to the periphery of the wheel, and the second subdomain, a four-helix bundle, is positioned near the center axle. The structure of the {ACP} subdomain is similar to that of decanoyl-{ACP} of Escherichia coli (Roujeinikova et al., 2007) (Figure 3C; Table S2). In our structure, {ACP} interacts with a {KS} dimer at the dimer interface via the N terminus of the {ACP} helix α2, which is a conserved region known to be important for {ACP} to interact with the catalytic domains of type {II} {FAS} (Zhang et al., 2003). This region of {ACP} contains Ser180, which was identified biochemically to be the active site ([Mohamed et al., 1988] and [Schreckenbach et al., 1977]). The Cα atom of Ser180 faces the deep cavity of the {KS} active site and lies about 18 Å from the Cα atom of the {KS} catalytic residue Cys1305. This distance is about the length of the pantetheine arm, and, therefore, the observed {ACP} is presumably in an active conformation. In addition, the second subdomain of domain 1 interacts with the hub of the central wheel. There is no electron density in the map for the N-terminal 136 residues and for about 60 residues that follow domain 1. Presumably these residues form a flexible region that allows {ACP} to move inside the chamber and reach the reaction centers. The striking architecture of the internal core of the central wheel is formed by two structural domains from six α subunits (Figure 2E). The first structural domain ({SD}1α, residues 360–420) is an L-shaped helix-turn-helix ({HTH}) motif that forms the axle and spoke of the central wheel. The N-terminal helix of {SD}1α is perpendicular to the plane of the wheel with three helices coiled above the plane and three below. These two inversely oriented trimers surround the 3-fold axis and comprise the axle at the center (Figure 2E). The C-terminal helix takes a sharp turn of about 90°, and three pairs of helices form the three spokes of the wheel (Figure 2E). The second structural domain of the α subunit ({SD}2α, residues 1110–1173) is an insertion in the C terminus of {KS}. {SD}2α extends toward the {FAS} center via a two-stranded arm. The core fold of the domain comprises a three-stranded β sheet packed against an α helix. Two {SD}2αs dimerize by pairing their β sheets side by side, thereby forming a six-stranded β sheet. They are located between spokes and around the axle and form the hub of the wheel (Figure 2E). The {KR} domain (residues 680–940) forms the core of domain 3 (residues 420–970; Figure 3D). The {KR} domain has all characteristics of the adenine dinucleotide phosphate ({NADPH}) binding Rossmann-fold domains (White et al., 2005) and superimposes well on that of the β-ketoacyl carrier protein reductase of Brassica napus (Fisher et al., 2000) (Table S2; Figure S1A). The Ser-Tyr-Lys triad residues shown previously to be involved in the catalysis and substrate binding in bacterial homologs (White et al., 2005) are identified in the {KR} active site to be residues Ser827, Tyr839, and Lys843 from our structural and sequence alignments (Figure 3D). The {KS} domain (domain 4, residues 1015–1109 and 1074–1661) has a thiolase fold (Figure 3E). The topology of the core of this domain is homologous to that of the bacterial counterpart of {KS}, which is the β-ketoacyl synthase I ({KAS} I) (Olsen et al., 1999) (Table S2; Figure S1B). Our structural and sequence alignments show that the {KS} residues Cys1305, His1542, and His1583 correspond to the catalytic triad of the {KAS} I/{II} family of condensing enzymes (White et al., 2005), and Phe1395 corresponds to the invariant phenylalanine of the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket in {KAS} I (Zhang et al., 2006). The {PPT} domain (domain 6, residues 1747–1887) lies at the C terminus of the α subunit (Figure 3A). The {PPT} domain is structurally homologous to its bacterial counterpart, Bacillus subtilis acyl carrier protein synthase ({AcpS}) (Parris et al., 2000) (Figure 3F; Table S2). The superimposition of the {PPT} and {AcpS} structures reveals that the conserved amino acid residues of yeast {PPT} (Lambalot et al., 1996) are located in the α subunit protuberance near a dimer interface (Figure 2C and Figure 3F). This interface is composed of two pairs of long antiparallel helices (sr2) (Figures 3A and 3E), which separate two {PPT} domains and prevent the formation of a {CoA} binding site observed in the {AcpS} trimer (Parris et al., 2000). This suggests that the {PPT} domains are in an inactive conformation in the assembled yeast {FAS} particle. The β subunit of yeast {FAS} is composed of four functional domains and four structural domains ({SDβ}) in the following order: {SD}1β, {AT}, {ER}, {SD}2β, {SD}3β, {DH}, {SD}4β, and {MPT} (Figure 4A). Unlike the structural domains in the α subunit, which are small and rely on multimerization to form unique domains, those in the β subunit are large, distinctive domains that function individually. Domain 1 ({SD}1β, residues 1–136) lies at the N terminus of the β subunit and forms a trimer interface around the 3-fold axis on the apices of the {FAS} barrel structure (Figure 2D). Previously, {SD}1β was interpreted to be the {PPT} domain of the α subunit (Jenni et al., 2006). Our electron density map of yeast {FAS} unambiguously identifies this region as being the N terminus of the β subunit. Two domains exhibiting a similar fold are located on opposite ends of the β subunit. The first is the {AT} domain (domain 2, residues 155–547), which uses exclusively acetyl-{CoA} as a substrate, is located just after {SDβ}1 (Figure 4A), and exists only in fungal {FAS} I systems. The second is the {MPT} domain (domain 8, residues 1616–2051) located at the C terminus of the β subunit (Figure 4A). Both domains have an α/β-hydrolase fold as a core structure as well as an insertion of a smaller ferredoxin-like subdomain (Figures 4B and 4C). They are structurally homologous to E. coli malonyl transacylase ({FabD}) ([Oefner et al., 2006] and [Serre et al., 1995]) (Table S2; Figure S3A). The interface between the hydrolase and the ferredoxin subdomains forms a gorge containing the active site at its end (Serre et al., 1995). The gorge in the yeast {AT} domain, especially around the active site, is narrower than those in {MPT} and {FabD} (Figure 4B; Figure S3A), which have the same size and accommodate the same substrate, malonate. Structural and sequence alignments identified four conserved active-site residues in the {AT} and {MPT} domains, which correspond to Gln11, Ser92, Arg117, and His201 required for catalysis and substrate recognition in {FabD} (Figures 4B and 4D). Among these, the arginine residue involved in the recognition of the free carboxyl group of the malonyl substrate in {FabD} (Oefner et al., 2006) is changed to an isoleucine in the yeast {AT} domain, whereas {MPT} has the same active-site residues as {FabD}. In the {AT} domain, the first loop of the “helical flap,” which is believed to form the binding site for the {ACP} (Keatinge-Clay et al., 2003), is shifted toward the active site by about 3 Å compared to its position in {MPT} or {FabD} (Figure S3A). These structural differences might contribute to the exclusive specificity of {AT} for the acetate substrate. The helical flap of the {MPT} domain has an insertion that extends toward the {KR} domain of a neighboring α subunit and forms an interface between {MPT} and {KR}. A tunnel-like cavity, emanating from the active site, is formed by this insertion and the side of the helical flap (Figure S3B). This cavity is long enough to accommodate a palmitoyl or stearyl group attached to {ACP}, which is delivered to {MPT} during the termination step of fatty acid synthesis. The {ER} domain (domain 3, residues 583–855 and 999–1065) uses flavin mononucleotide ({FMN}), in addition to {NADPH}, as a cofactor for catalysis, which is a distinctive feature of fungal {FAS} ([Fox and Lynen, 1980] and [Lynen, 1967]). The yeast {ER} domain has the {TIM}-barrel fold (Figures 4A and 4E). It shows the strongest structural similarity to the 2-nitropropane dioxygenase ({NPD}) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ha et al., 2006), with a Z score of 27.7 (Table S2; Figure S2B), significantly higher than that of 12.5 for superimposition with the spinach glycolate oxidase placed in the lower-resolution map of fungal {FAS} (Jenni et al., 2006). The electron density map of yeast {FAS} clearly shows a bound {FMN} at the same position as in the {NPD} structure (Figure 1B). Although {FMN} was not present in the crystallization buffer, it is known that it always remains bound to the yeast {FAS} during purification (Lynen, 1969). The {DH} domain (domain 6, residues 1235–1378 and 1493–1614, Figure 4A) is composed of two subdomains of the “hot-dog fold,” which was first identified in {FabA}, the E. coli dehydratase of type {II} {FAS} (Leesong et al., 1996). Two subdomains ({DHn} and {DHc}) are arranged side by side as a pseudodimer, which creates a 10-stranded antiparallel β sheet (Figure 4F). The structure of the {DH} pseudodimer aligns best with that of the yeast Candida tropicalis 2-enoyl-{CoA} hydratase 2 (Koski et al., 2004) (Table S2; Figure S2A). The alignment allows the active-site amino acid residues of {DH} to be identified as Asp1559 and His1564 in the C-terminal subdomain ({DHc}, Figure 4F). This confirms that there is only one active site in the yeast {DH} pseudodimer, in contrast to the two active sites formed in the 3(R)-hydroxyacyl-{ACP} dehydratase homodimers of type {II} {FAS} (White et al., 2005). The crystal structure of yeast {FAS} reveals that this large, macromolecular assembly functions as a six-chambered reactor for fatty acid synthesis. Each of the six chambers functions independently and has in its chamber wall all of the catalytic units required for fatty acid priming, elongation, and termination, while one substrate-shuttling component, {ACP}, is located inside each chamber and functions like a swinging arm. Surprisingly, however, the step at which the reactor is activated must occur before the complete assembly of the particle since the {PPT} domain that attaches the pantetheine arm to {ACP} lies outside the assembly, inaccessible to {ACP} that lies inside. Remarkably, the architectural complexity of the {FAS} particle results in the simplicity of the reaction mechanisms for fatty acid synthesis in fungi. The geometry of {ACP} and the catalytic centers suggests an elegant mechanism by which {ACP} delivers substrates to the catalytic centers via two-dimensional diffusion in a swinging manner (Figure 5). Several structural features clearly support this model. First, {ACP} is a rigid domain that is tethered at one end to the center of the {FAS} particle via a flexible hinge region, while its opposite end that contains the substrate attachment site faces the active centers in the chamber wall. This suggests that {ACP} may function as a rigid body and that the flexible hinge allows {ACP} to swing in order to delivery substrates. The swinging movement of {ACP} is further supported by the distances between the hinge region, the pivot point of the rotation, and the active centers. These distances range between about 70 Å to 80 Å, which matches the distance between the hinge region and substrate-binding end of the pantetheine arm attached to {ACP}. As a consequence, a pure swinging motion of {ACP} is sufficient to deliver substrates close to all of the active centers. This results in a two-dimensional diffusion process for substrate delivery, which significantly increases the effective concentration of the substrates on top of that already achieved by the compartmentalization of the reactions inside the {FAS} particle. Presumably, conformational changes can occur in the hinge region when {ACP} swings. That, together with the flexibility of pantetheine arm, will allow substrates to reach their exact positions in the catalytic centers. The spatial arrangement of {ACP} and catalytic centers allows us to deduce the pathway traveled by each {ACP} to deliver substrates to a unique set of reaction centers, which identifies six separate and independent reaction chambers in the {FAS} particle, three in each half-barrel (Figure 5; Movie S2). Our criteria for defining the unique set of reaction centers and the travel path for each {ACP} are the following. First, the distances between these reaction centers and the {ACP} hinge region should be the shortest ones and should match the length of {ACP}. Second, {ACP} should shuttle substrates between the shortest pair of reaction centers. Third, when {ACP} moves among these reaction centers, there should be no steric hindrances, and different {ACPs} should not cross each other's paths because of the large size of each {ACP} domain and the hinge region. Notably, the structural insertion (sr1) in the {KS} domain forms a divider that helps to define the reaction chamber (Figure 5B). Using these criteria, we conclude that each reaction chamber is composed of seven catalytic centers from two α and two β subunits. In case of reaction chamber 1, they are {ACP} and {KR} from α1, {KS} from α2, {MPT} and {DH} from β1, and {AT} and {ER} from β3 (numbering as in Figure 2). Upon being primed at the {AT} domain located in the ceiling of the chamber, {ACP} subsequently lowers its position to shuttle substrates in the elongation cycles ({KS}→{MPT}→{KS}→{KR}→{DH}→{ER}) and finally brings the fatty acid to the {MPT} domain for product release. Several experimental observations support this proposal that the independent reaction chamber consists of catalytic centers from more than one set of α and β subunits. Our model explains the unusually high frequency of intra-allelic complementation of yeast {FAS} mutations (Dietlein and Schweizer, 1975), in which mutation in a distinct domain of one subunit can be complemented by the coexpression of the allelic subunit with mutation in another domain. The {KS} and {KR} domains in our model come from two α subunits, which would predict about 25\% restoration of activity for their complementary mutations. This was experimentally observed in vivo and in vitro for the reconstituted α subunit mutants (Werkmeister et al., 1981). Moreover, the fact that the expression of truncated β subunit (Δ{DH}, Δ{MPT}) was able to complement a β subunit mutation at the {ER} domain (Chirala et al., 1987) also supports the model proposed here. Substrate delivery by {ACP} is achieved by its docking onto the catalytic domains primarily through the electrostatic interactions, seen in the interface between {ACP} and {KS} and indicated by the surface electrostatic charge potential distributions around other active centers (Figure 6A). In the present {FAS} structure, {ACP} is bound to the {KS} domain, which represents, to our knowledge, the first structure of an active {ACP} complex with a {FAS} catalytic domain. The interface is not extensive, involving only about ten amino acids near Ser180, the pantetheine arm attachment site located at the tip of {ACP}. The small interface is perhaps expected because the substrate-delivering role of {ACP} requires a weak and transient interaction. We calculated the surface charge potential distribution around the active centers of {KS}, {KR}, {AT}, and {MPT}. A striking feature that emerges is a prominent positive patch next to the active-site cavity of each catalytic domain. In the interface observed between {ACP} and {KS}, this positive patch harbors the negatively charged helix α2 of {ACP}, which has been proposed to be a “recognition helix” for recruiting {ACP} to the active centers (White et al., 2005). It is likely that these positive patches serve as electrostatic loading docks for {ACP}. This is supported by extensive biochemical studies leading to the conclusion that {ACP} interacts with different enzymes through a conserved set of electrostatic and/or hydrophobic contacts (Zhang et al., 2003). The current position of {ACP} on the {KS} domain is stabilized by additional interactions between the four-helix bundle in domain 1 that lies C-terminal to {ACP} and the “hub” domain in the central wheel (Figure 6B). These interactions would be absent from the interactions of {ACP} with other catalytic domains, which may explain in part why {ACP} is not randomly distributed among six different active centers. Functionally, this means that {ACP} stays significantly longer at the {KS} domain than at all other active centers. This is required because {KS} catalyzes the condensation reaction, which is a critical step in which precise stereochemistry of two substrates (malonate and acyl chain) needs to be satisfied. In addition, {ACP} moves twice to the {KS} domain during each elongation cycle, which effectively doubles the probability of an {ACP}-{KS} complex. The location of the yeast {PPT} domain outside of the {FAS} particle immediately suggests that the activation of {ACP}, which is located inside the particle, must occur before the particle is fully assembled. Because the yeast {FAS} particle has a rigid wall structure whose pores are not large enough for the passage of either {ACP} or {PPT}, the catalytic attachment of the pantetheine arm to {ACP} must take place before the formation of the particle wall. This wall is formed mainly by the β subunits, which means that activation occurs before the association of the α and β subunits. The activation step could occur either after dimerization of two α subunits forms a {PPT} dimer or subsequent to the assembly of the entire α6 hexamer. Several observations support this proposal. The active site of the bacterial homolog of {PPT} is formed at its dimeric interface, possibly inside a trimer ([Lambalot and Walsh, 1995], [Reuter et al., 1999] and [Parris et al., 2000]). In addition, monomeric {PPT} was found to be inactive when individual {PPT} and {ACP} domains of yeast {FAS} were cloned and expressed (Lambalot and Walsh, 1995). Furthermore, in order to bring the active centers of {ACP} and {PPT} together, their relative orientations must be different from that observed in the full {FAS} particle. We further postulate that the α6 hexamer is the platform for the subsequent assembly of the β subunits after {ACP} activation. This agrees well with the finding that the β subunit in its monomeric form is able to catalyze multiple enzymatic reactions, while the α subunit needs a higher aggregated state for its enzymatic activities (Wieland et al., 1979). The requirement for activation of {ACP} before the particle is completely assembled could explain a series of intriguing biochemical experiments. The {ACP} of a mutant {FAS}, in which the {PPT} domain has been deleted, cannot be activated simply by mixing it with a complementary {FAS} mutant carrying wild-type {PPT} but lacking {ACP} activity. However, when both mutants are dissociated, mixed, and subsequently reassociated, the resulting hybrid {FAS} has about 20\% of the wild-type {FAS} activity and about 50\% of the activity of the same hybrid {FAS} formed in vivo (Fichtlscherer et al., 2000). The formation of an active hybrid in vitro is critically dependent on the addition of {CoA}, demonstrating that {PPT} is able to transfer the pantetheine arm from {CoA} to {ACP} during the dissociation-reassociation process. Yeast {FAS} uses the size and surface charge/hydrophobicity property at the substrate-binding pocket to select acetyl-{CoA} at the {AT} domain during priming and the malonyl-{CoA} at the {MPT} domain during elongation. Both domains transfer the acyl group from the {CoA} thioester to {ACP}. Sequence and structural alignments identify Arg1834 in the {MPT} domain to be the invariant Arg117 in {FabD}, which forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of the malonyl moiety (Oefner et al., 2006), explaining this domain's preference for malonyl-{CoA} as substrate. In contrast, two properties of the active-site gorge of {AT} dictate its exclusive specificity for acetyl-{CoA}. First, the {AT} gorge is narrower than those of {MPT} and {FabD} so that the malonyl moiety cannot be placed close enough to the catalytic residue Ser274 without clashing with surrounding amino acids (Figure 4D). Moreover, the amino acid residue corresponding to the invariant Arg117 in {FabD} is changed to an isoleucine in {AT}. The replacement of the positively charged arginine by the hydrophobic isoleucine could shift the substrate preference to an uncharged and more hydrophobic acetate moiety of the acetyl-{CoA}. Indeed, the mutation of the corresponding arginine to an alanine in the acyltransferase domain of rat {FAS} decreased the substrate specificity for malonyl-{CoA} by three orders of magnitude and, at the same time, increased the specificity for acetyl-{CoA} by two orders of magnitude (Rangan and Smith, 1997). The tunnel-like cavity that lies near the active site of the {MPT} domain may explain a second catalytic activity unique to fungal {FAS}—the transfer of the final palmitic/stearic acid product from {ACP} to {CoA} during the termination step ([Engeser et al., 1979] and [Schuster et al., 1995]). The length of the tunnel is sufficient to accommodate a 16- or 18-carbon chain, and the end of the tunnel is hydrophobic (Figures S3B and S3C). This means that only the palmitic/stearic acid is long enough to reach the hydrophobic region and consequently become a stably bound substrate of {MPT}. It was posited nearly three decades ago that, at some distance from the active center, “a hydrophobic region participates in recognition of the palmitoyl residues” (Engeser et al., 1979). The partially open side of the tunnel is adjacent to a large pore on the {FAS} particle, which presumably facilitates the release and diffusion of palmitoyl-{CoA} outside of the {FAS} complex. The existence of this product-binding tunnel next to the active center also has implications for control of the initiation of fatty acid synthesis. A bound palmitoyl-{CoA} product would block the binding of the elongation substrate, malonyl-{CoA}, to the {MPT} active site. As a consequence, only acetyl-{CoA} at the {AT} domain would be available for {ACP} to bind. This ensures both the termination of the reaction and that the priming substrate, acetate, enters the next round of fatty acid synthesis at the very start. This controlling mechanism increases the efficiency of the fatty acid synthesis and is different from the ping-pong mechanism proposed for all other {FAS} systems ([White et al., 2005] and [Smith et al., 2003]). Targeting the enoyl reductase in fatty acid synthesis has been shown to be a viable antibacterial approach (Zhang et al., 2006). Antifungal compounds designed to target yeast {ER} may be safe to the host because yeast and animal {ERs} belong to different families of enoyl reductases. A unique property of the yeast {ER} is its use of {FMN} as an intermediate hydrogen carrier, a hallmark of the recently discovered {FabK} family of bacterial enoyl-{ACP} reductases. ([Heath and Rock, 2000], [Marrakchi et al., 2003] and [White et al., 2005]). In contrast, the {FabI}-like enoyl reductase in animal type I {FAS} systems directly transfers the reduction hydrogen from {NADPH} to the fatty acid intermediate (Lynen, 1980), suggesting that different chemistry is used for catalysis. The sequence and structure of the yeast {ER} are not similar to those of {FabI} enzymes. Instead, the amino acid sequence of yeast {ER} has over 30\% similarity to that of {FabK} enzymes (Figure S4). Moreover, {FabK} enzymes were discovered by their appearance as the source of bacterial resistance that developed to the antibiotic triclosan (Heath and Rock, 2000), to which yeast type I {FAS} is also resistant (Torkko et al., 2003). This structure of a {FabK}-like yeast enoyl reductase should assist the investigation into the source of this antibiotic resistance and might enable structure-based design of antibacterial and antifungal pharmaceuticals. S. cerevisiae cells were harvested at log phase, washed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Seventy grams of cell pellet was thawed, and cells were disrupted in a Microfluidizer at maximum pressure. The lysate was cleared and {FAS} was pelleted by overnight centrifugation at 70,000 × g. The pellet was dissolved and centrifugated through a 10 ml sucrose cushion, loaded onto a 10\%–40\% linear sucrose density gradient, and centrifugated again. {FAS}-containing fractions were dialyzed and run through an anion exchange (see Supplemental Data). The concentrated enzyme (6 mg/ml) has a light yellow color because of the presence of bound {FMN} (Lynen, 1969). Two crystal forms with space groups P21 and P43212 were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method from a 7:3 mixture of sample (7 μl) with a solution (3 μl) containing 15\% {PEG} 3350, 20 {mM} {HEPES}-{KOH} ({pH} 7.5), 3 {mM} magnesium acetate, 0.3 M {KCl}, 30 {mM} {CaCl}2, and 1 {mM} {DTT}. Both crystals diffracted to a resolution of 4 Å at synchrotron beamlines. The P21 crystal rapidly decayed upon exposure to X-ray, resulting in weak data in the highest resolution shell. Data were processed using {HKL}2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The statistics are summarized in Table S1. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser ({McCoy}, 2007) using the Cα atom coordinates of homologous domains that had been fitted to a 5 Å resolution map of fungal {FAS} by Jenni et al. (2006) ({PDB} {ID} code 2CDH). Dramatic phase improvements were achieved by interactive cycles of 9-fold {NCS} averaging between the two crystal forms using the program Dmmulti (Cowtan and Main, 1996). The careful construction of envelope masks around the density used for averaging masks was crucial in bringing up the electron density corresponding to the less well-ordered {ACP} and {PPT} domains. The use of weak data in the P21 crystal form and the sharpening of the diffraction data amplitudes by a B factor of −120 significantly improved the quality of the electron density map. The detailed procedures used for phase extension and improvement will be published elsewhere (Y.X., unpublished data). Although the resolution limit of our diffraction data is 4 Å, the extremely well-determined phases arising from the averaging procedures produced an electron density map in which the side chains of a majority of the amino acid residues could be seen. The final model was rebuilt with the graphics programs O (Jones et al., 1991) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), in which about 50\% of the residues were built as polyalanine. Surprisingly, our electron density map shows additional residues that are not predicted from the available amino acid sequence of the β subunit of yeast {FAS}. These 100 extra residues are dispersed as several segments in the C-terminal part of the {MPT} domain based on sequence and structural alignments of functional homologs of {MPT} domains. We have been unable to verify the molecular weight of the β subunit with either electrophoresis or mass spectroscopy. A rigid-body refinement and iterative cycles of positional and individual B factor refinement using {CNS} (Brunger et al., 1998) gave the final model an Rfactor/Rfree of 31.9\%/34.6\%. The success of the refinement was aided by including the {NCS}-averaged phases in the maximum-likelihood target function and imposing a tight 3-fold {NCS} restraint. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1.

	abstract = {{OleA} is a thiolase superfamily enzyme that has been shown to catalyze the condensation of two long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A ({CoA}) substrates. The enzyme is part of a larger gene cluster responsible for generating long-chain olefin products, a potential biofuel precursor. In thiolase superfamily enzymes, catalysis is achieved via a ping-pong mechanism. The first substrate forms a covalent intermediate with an active site cysteine that is followed by reaction with the second substrate. For {OleA}, this conjugation proceeds by a nondecarboxylative Claisen condensation. The {OleA} from Xanthomonas campestris has been crystallized and its structure determined, along with inhibitor-bound and xenon-derivatized structures, to improve our understanding of substrate positioning in the context of enzyme turnover. {OleA} is the first characterized thiolase superfamily member that has two long-chain alkyl substrates that need to be bound simultaneously and therefore uniquely requires an additional alkyl binding channel. The location of the fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitor, cerulenin, that possesses an alkyl chain length in the range of known {OleA} substrates, in conjunction with a single xenon binding site, leads to the putative assignment of this novel alkyl binding channel. Structural overlays between the {OleA} homologues, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-{CoA} ({HMG}-{CoA}) synthase and the fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme {FabH}, allow assignment of the two remaining channels: one for the thioester-containing pantetheinate arm and the second for the alkyl group of one substrate. A short β-hairpin region is ordered in only one of the crystal forms, and that may suggest open and closed states relevant for substrate binding. Cys143 is the conserved catalytic cysteine within the superfamily, and the site of alkylation by cerulenin. The alkylated structure suggests that a glutamic acid residue (Glu117β) likely promotes Claisen condensation by acting as the catalytic base. Unexpectedly, Glu117β comes from the other monomer of the physiological dimer.},

	abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 {rbcL} sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is implemented in the {PHYML} program, which is freely available on our web page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/{MAAS}/.},

The primary feature of the Dictionary is an authoritative consensus classification of the fungi, that has been widely accepted as an enabling and informing framework for research into pure and applied mycology. Fungal Families of the World has been conceived as an illustrative and more approachable companion to the Dictionary. Second it provides further substantial information on the 536 currently accepted families of Fungi, with more detailed descriptions and notes on ecology, economic uses, and the like. Third (and perhaps most importantly), it depicts the extraordinary range of morphological structures found in fungi, celebrating myco-diversity and perhaps stimulating interest in mycology by those individuals outside the inner circle of fungal systematists. The taxonomic framework for Fungal Families of the World is based upon that of the ninth edition of Dictionary but has been substantially updated to confirm with the findings of two major {US}-led research projects on fungal systematics, popularly referred to as Deep Hydra and {AFTOL} (Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life). The book contains images for over 400 families of the Fung, representing substantially wider fungal diversity than has been achieved before in a single publication. Where practical illustration of both macroscopic and microscopic features have been included. Fungal Families of the World will be of great value to students and researchers in biology, ecology and conservation, to mycologists, agriculturalists and foresters and serves as an informative companion to the Dictionary of the Fungi.},

	abstract = {The homothallic ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans serves as model organism for filamentous fungi because of its ability to propagate with both asexual and sexual life cycles, and fatty acid-derived substances regulate the balance between both cycles. These so-called psi (precocious sexual inducer) factors are produced by psi factor-producing oxygenases (Ppo enzymes). Bioinformatic analysis predicted the presence of two different heme domains in Ppo proteins: in the N-terminal region, a fatty acid heme dioxygenase/peroxidase domain is predicted, whereas in the C-terminal region, a P450 heme thiolate domain is predicted. To analyze the reaction catalyzed by Ppo enzymes, {PpoA} was expressed in Escherichia coli as an active enzyme. The protein was purified by 62-fold and identified as a homotetrameric ferric heme protein that metabolizes mono- as well as polyunsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids at {pH} ∼7.25. The presence of thiolate-ligated heme was confirmed on the basis of sequence alignments and the appearance of a characteristic 450 nm {CO}-binding spectrum. Studies on its reaction mechanism revealed that {PpoA} uses different heme domains to catalyze two separate reactions. Within the heme peroxidase domain, linoleic acid is oxidized to (8R)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid by abstracting a H-atom from C-8 of the fatty acid, yielding a carbon-centered radical that reacts with molecular dioxygen. In the second reaction step, 8-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid is isomerized within the P450 heme thiolate domain to 5,8-dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. We identify {PpoA} as a bifunctional P450 fusion protein that uses a previously unknown reaction mechanism for forming psi factors.},

We describe a straightforward strategy that combines the power of advanced {DNA} engineering (recombiogenic cloning) in Escherichia coli with the utility of pseudomonads as the heterologous host for the analysis and mutagenesis of known and unknown secondary metabolite pathways. The myxochromide S biosynthetic gene cluster from Stigmatella aurantiaca was rebuilt and engineered in E. coli to contain the elements required for expression in pseudomonads. The successful production in Pseudomonas putida, at unprecedented levels, demonstrates the feasibility of the new approach to the analysis and mutagenesis of these important pathways.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli lactose permease ({LacY}) transports sugar across the inner membrane of the bacterium using the proton motive force to accumulate sugar in the cytosol. We have probed lactose conduction across {LacY} using steered molecular dynamics, permitting us to follow molecular and energetic details of lactose interaction with the lumen of {LacY} during its permeation. Lactose induces a widening of the narrowest parts of the channel during permeation, the widening being largest within the periplasmic half-channel. During permeation, the water-filled lumen of {LacY} only partially hydrates lactose, forcing it to interact with channel lining residues. Lactose forms a multitude of direct sugar-channel hydrogen bonds, predominantly with residues of the flexible N-domain, which is known to contribute a major part of {LacY}'s affinity for lactose. In the periplasmic half-channel lactose predominantly interacts with hydrophobic channel lining residues, whereas in the cytoplasmic half-channel key protein-substrate interactions are mediated by ionic residues. A major energy barrier against transport is found within a tight segment of the periplasmic half-channel where sugar hydration is minimal and protein-sugar interaction maximal. Upon unbinding from the binding pocket, lactose undergoes a rotation to permeate either half-channel with its long axis aligned parallel to the channel axis. The results hint at the possibility of a transport mechanism, in which lactose permeates {LacY} through a narrow periplasmic half-channel and a wide cytoplasmic half-channel, the opening of which is controlled by changes in protonation states of key protein side groups.},

The energetics and mechanism of drug extrusion mediated by {LmrP} were studied in membrane vesicles of E. coli. {LmrP}-mediated extrusion of tetraphenyl phosphonium ({TPP}+) from right-side-out membrane vesicles and uptake of the fluorescent membrane probe 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene ({TMA}-{DPH}) into inside-out membrane vesicles are driven by the membrane potential ([Delta][psi]) and the transmembrane proton gradient ([Delta]{pH}), pointing to an electrogenic drug/proton antiport mechanism. Ethidium bromide, a substrate for {LmrP}, inhibited the {LmrP}-mediated {TPP}+ extrusion from right-side-out membrane vesicles, showing that {LmrP} is capable of transporting structurally unrelated drugs. Kinetic analysis of {LmrP}-mediated {TMA}-{DPH} transport revealed a direct relation between the transport rate and the amount of {TMA}-{DPH} associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer. This observation indicates that drugs are extruded from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane into the external medium. This is the first report that shows that drug extrusion by a secondary multidrug resistance ({MDR}) transporter occurs by a ``hydrophobic vacuum cleaner'' mechanism in a similar way as was proposed for the primary lactococcal {MDR} transporter, {LmrA}.},

	abstract = {Summary The genus Aspergillus is renowned for its ability to produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although the propensity of biosynthetic genes to form contiguous clusters greatly facilitates assignment of putative secondary metabolite genes in the completed Aspergillus genomes, such analysis cannot predict gene expression and, ultimately, product formation. To circumvent this deficiency, we have examined Aspergillus nidulans microarrays for expressed secondary metabolite gene clusters by using the transcriptional regulator {LaeA}. Deletion or overexpression of {laeA} clearly identified numerous secondary metabolite clusters. A gene deletion in one of the clusters eliminated the production of the antitumor compound terrequinone A, a metabolite not described, from A. nidulans. In this paper, we highlight that {LaeA}-based genome mining helps decipher the secondary metabolome of Aspergilli and provides an unparalleled view to assess secondary metabolism gene regulation.},

On a whole plant basis (aerial parts) the trans-piperitone oxide content ranged from 1.4 \% location (Loc 1) to 32.5\% (Loc 3) and appeared to have an inverse relationship with the 1,8-cineole content which ranged from 10.8 \% (Loc 3) to 37.9 \% (Loc 1). 1,8-cineole was the major oil constituent (37.9 \%) of M. spicata plants from Loc 1. The major constituent of the inflorescence oils was piperitenone oxide which ranged from 32.4 \% (Loc 3) to 46.3 \% of the oil (Loc 1). The major constituent of the leaf oils was 1,8-cineole (40.5 \%) in plants from Loc 1 and trans-piperitone oxide in plants from Loc 2 (19.8 \%) and Loc 3 (33.5 \%). This is the first report for wild populations in Greece of a M. spicata oil in which 1,8-cineole is the major constituent. The observed variation in essential oil composition between locations and plant organs in July would not appear to be directly related to the climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {The study presents cost–benefit analyses of walking and cycling track networks in three Norwegian cities. The cost–benefit analyses take into account the benefit of reduced insecurity and the health benefits of the improved fitness the use of non-motorized transport provides. In addition to reductions in health costs, the analyses also take into account that a change from travel by car to cycling or walking means reduced external costs (e.g. air pollution and noise) from motorized traffic and reduced parking costs. The benefits of investments in cycle networks are estimated to be at least 4–5 times the costs. Such investments are thus more beneficial to society than other transport investments. The results of such complete cost–benefit analyses make it possible to calculate the benefits to society that are not realized because motorized traffic prevents people from bicycling or walking as much as they otherwise would prefer. These “barrier costs” attributable to motorized traffic are estimated to be of at least the same magnitude as air pollution costs and more than double the noise costs. Barrier costs should therefore be taken into account in the same way as other external costs, when the issue is to determine the proper level of car taxes or to evaluate different kinds of restrictions on car use.},

Here, we report the x-ray crystal structure, at 3.7 angstrom resolution, of one conformational state of the {EmrE} transporter in complex with a translocation substrate, tetraphenylphosphonium. Two {EmrE} polypeptides form a homodimeric transporter that binds substrate at the dimerization interface. The two subunits have opposite orientations in the membrane and adopt slightly different folds, forming an asymmetric antiparallel dimer. This unusual architecture likely confers unidirectionality to transport by creating an asymmetric substrate translocation pathway. On the basis of available structural data, we propose a model for the proton-dependent drug efflux mechanism of {EmrE}.},

Key steps in understanding the transport process are binding of drug substrates in the transmembrane domains, initiation of {ATPase} activity, and subsequent drug efflux. We used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the transmembrane segment residues and reaction with the thiol-reactive drug substrate analog of rhodamine, methane-thiosulfonate-rhodamine ({MTS}-rhodamine), to test whether P-gp could be trapped in an activated state with high levels of {ATPase} activity. The presence of such an activated P-gp could be used to further investigate P-gp-drug substrate interactions. Single cysteine mutants (149) were treated with {MTS}-rhodamine, and {ATPase} activities were determined after removal of unreacted {MTS}-rhodamine. One mutant, F343C({TM}6), showed a 5.8-fold increase in activity after reaction with {MTS}-rhodamine. Pre-treatment of mutant F343C with rhodamine B protected it from activation by {MTS}-rhodamine, indicating that residue Cys-343 contributes to the rhodamine-binding site. The {ATPase} activity of {MTS}-rhodamine-treated mutant F343C, however, was not stimulated further by colchicine or calcein-{AM}. By contrast, verapamil and Hoechst 33342 stimulated and inhibited, respectively, the {ATPase} activity of the {MTS}-rhodamine-treated mutant F343C. These results indicate that the {MTS}-rhodamine binding site overlaps that of colchicine and calcein-{AM} but not that of verapamil and Hoechst 33342 within the common drug-binding pocket.},

Recently, pinene dimers were shown to have a volumetric heating value similar to that of the tactical fuel {JP}-10. To provide a sustainable source of pinene, we engineered Escherichia coli for pinene production. We combinatorially expressed three pinene synthases ({PS}) and three geranyl diphosphate synthases ({GPPS}), with the best combination achieving ?28 mg/L of pinene. We speculated that pinene toxicity was limiting production; however, toxicity should not be limiting at current titers. Because {GPPS} is inhibited by geranyl diphosphate ({GPP}) and to increase flux through the pathway, we combinatorially constructed {GPPS}-{PS} protein fusions. The Abies grandis {GPPS}-{PS} fusion produced 32 mg/L of pinene, a 6-fold improvement over the highest titer previously reported in engineered E. coli. Finally, we investigated the pinene isomer ratio of our pinene-producing microbe and discovered that the isomer profile is determined not only by the identity of the {PS} used but also by the identity of the {GPPS} with which the {PS} is paired. We demonstrated that the {GPP} concentration available to {PS} for cyclization alters the pinene isomer ratio.},

	abstract = {Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous fungi that inhabit healthy plant tissues without causing disease. Endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and may be important, but often overlooked, components of fungal biodiversity. In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness, host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347 genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single isolate (59\%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.},

	note = {There is a single major alcohol dehydrogenase ({ADH}) and a single major aldehyde dehydrogenase ({AldDH}) in Aspergillus nidulans. Both {ADH} and {AldDH} are induced by ethanol and by acetaldehyde and both are subject to carbon catabolite repression. {ADH} and {AldDH} are necessary for the utilization of ethanol and of threonine, indicating that both compounds are utilized via acetaldehyde. {ADH} and {AldDH} each give a single major activity band on gel electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell extracts shows at least two similar {ADH} polypeptides of approximate relative molecular mass (r.m.m.) 41 000 and two similar {AldDH} polypeptides of approximate r.m.m. 57 000. The in vitro translation of {mRNA} from induced, carbon derepressed wild-type cells gives up to three {ADH} polypeptides in the r.m.m. range 39 000-43 000 and an {AldDH} polypeptide of approximate r.m.m. 57 000. The {mRNA} from uninduced, carbon repressed wild-type cells does not direct the synthesis of the {ADH} and {AldDH} polypeptides. This indicates that the regulation of {ADH} and {AldDH} is at the level of transcription and/or post-transcriptional modification. The probable explanation of the multiple {ADH} polypeptides is post-transcriptional modification of the {mRNA}. Allyl alcohol mutants were made by using diepoxyoctane and γ -rays as mutagens. There are two classes, {alcA} and {alcR}. Neither class can utilize ethanol or threonine as a carbon source. The {alcA} mutants lack normal {ADH} and are recessive. Of the 47 {alcA} mutants examined 39 do not make the {ADH} polypeptides while eight do so. Therefore {alcA} is the structural gene for {ADH}. The two {alcA} mutants tested do not make functional {mRNA} for {ADH}. The {alcR} mutants lack both {ADH} and {AldDH} and are recessive. No {alcR} mutants make the {ADH} or the {AldDH} polypeptides. The three {alcR} mutants tested do not make functional {ADH} or {AldDH} {mRNA}. The mutant {alcR}125 is a nonsense mutant, which establishes that {alcR} codes for a protein. The {alcA} and {alcR} genes are adjacent on chromosome {VII} and a preliminary fine-structure map of the {alcA} gene has been made. Three mutants that cannot utilize ethanol or threonine and have {ADH}, but lack {AldDH}, define a gene {AldA} on chromosome {VIII}. The {aldA}25 mutant makes the {AldDH} polypeptides, the other two {aldA} mutants do not. Therefore {aldA} is probably the structural gene for {AldDH}. Our current hypothesis is that {alcA} and {aldA} are the structural genes for {ADH} and {AldDH} respectively and {alcR} is a transacting regulatory gene coding for a protein whose function is necessary for the expression of the {alcA} and {aldA} genes.},

Digitalis, morphine and quinine are plant secondary metabolites, whereas penicillin, cephalosporin, ergotrate and the statins are equally well known fungal secondary metabolites. Although chemically diverse, all secondary metabolites are produced by a few common biosynthetic pathways, often in conjunction with morphological development. Recent advances in molecular biology, bioinformatics and comparative genomics have revealed that the genes encoding specific fungal secondary metabolites are clustered and often located near telomeres. In this review, we address some important questions, including which evolutionary pressures led to gene clustering, why closely related species produce different profiles of secondary metabolites, and whether fungal genomics will accelerate the discovery of new pharmacologically active natural products.},

A dataset was prepared with {rDNA} sequences data from 108 isolates, among which we sampled 85 taxa representing four orders and 16 families in the Leotiomycetes. Equally weighted parsimony and Bayesian analyses were performed. Bootstrap proportion and Bayesian posterior probability under the {GTR}+\{Gamma\}+I model were estimated along the branches. Based on our results the Leotiomycetes is relatively well defined as a class and it includes the Cyttariales, Erysiphales, Helotiales, Rhytismatales and two families of uncertain position, Myxotrichaceae and Pseudeurotiaceae. The placements of the Thelebolales and Ascocorticiaceae are not examined and are accepted as tentative in the Leotiomycetes. Our results agree with previous studies to remove the Geoglossaceae, including Geoglossum, Trichoglossum and Sarcoleotia, from the Leotiomycetes. Positions of the Erysiphales and Rhytismatales in the Leotiomycetes are confirmed. The Helotiales and Myxotrichaceae are paraphyletic. Close relationships are supported strongly among the Hemiphacidiaceae, Rutstroemiaceae and Sclerotiniaceae, among Loramycetaceae, the northern hemisphere Vibrisseaceae, the Dark Septate Endophyte fungus Phialocephala fortinii and Mollisia cinerea, and between species of Bulgaria and Phadidiopycnis.

Here, we report the development of an algorithm for genome assembly, {ALLPATHS}-{LG}, and its application to massively parallel {DNA} sequence data from the human and mouse genomes, generated on the Illumina platform. The resulting draft genome assemblies have good accuracy, short-range contiguity, long-range connectivity, and coverage of the genome. In particular, the base accuracy is high (≥99.95\%) and the scaffold sizes (N50 size = 11.5 Mb for human and 7.2 Mb for mouse) approach those obtained with capillary-based sequencing. The combination of improved sequencing technology and improved computational methods should now make it possible to increase dramatically the de novo sequencing of large genomes.

Conditions were determined to induce the perfect stage (teleomorph) of this organism in the laboratory as a critical first step to study inheritance of taxol biosynthetic genes. The perfect stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora {NE}-32 forms in a period of 3-6 weeks on water agarose with dried yew needles at 16-20 degrees C with 12 h of light per day. Morphological analysis of the teleomorph and sequencing of the 18S {rDNA} indicates that Pestalosphaeria hansenii is the perfect stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora. Only certain plants (e.g. yews, some pines, pecan, oat and some barley cultivars) allow the production of perithecia. Exhaustive methylene chloride extraction of yew (Taxus cuspidata) needles removes their capacity to induce production of perithecia. The methylene chloride extract is able to induce formation of perithecia by strain {NE}-32 in a bioassay system utilizing the sterilized sheaths of the Cholla cactus (Opuntia bigelovii) spine, indicating that a chemical compound(s) in yew stimulates the formation of the perfect stage. This hydrophobic plant compound(s) has been designated the perithecial-stimulating factor ({PSF}).

The ubiquitous Ramachandran plot of backbone dihedral angles (φ and ψ) defined the allowed regions of conformational space. These predictions were subsequently confirmed in proteins of known structure. Ramachandran and colleagues also investigated the influence of the backbone angle τ on the distribution of allowed φ/ψ combinations. The “bridge region” (φ ≤ 0° and −20° ≤ ψ ≤ 40°) was predicted to be particularly sensitive to the value of τ. Here we present an analysis of the distribution of φ/ψ angles in 850 non-homologous proteins whose structures are known to a resolution of 1.7 Å or less and sidechain B-factor less than 30 Å2. We show that the distribution of φ/ψ angles for all 87,000 residues in these proteins shows the same dependence on τ as predicted by Ramachandran and colleagues. Our results are important because they make clear that steric constraints alone are sufficient to explain the backbone dihedral angle distributions observed in proteins. Contrary to recent suggestions, no additional energetic contributions, such as hydrogen bonding, need be invoked.},

In this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of {CD} patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later using {FISH} analysis. We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative recurrence of ileal {CD}. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii we analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models) and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid ({TNBS})-induced] colitis in mice. In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for {NF}-κB activity, F. prausnitzii had no effect on {IL}-1β-induced {NF}-κB activity, whereas the supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower {IL}-12 and {IFN}-γ production levels and higher secretion of {IL}-10. Oral administration of either live F. prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of {TNBS} colitis and tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with {TNBS} colitis, as demonstrated by real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) analysis. F. prausnitzii exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and {TNBS} colitis models, partly due to secreted metabolites able to block {NF}-κB activation and {IL}-8 production. These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. prausnitzii as a probiotic is a promising strategy in {CD} treatment.},

	abstract = {Background Crohn’s disease ({CD})-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined.
Methods Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. In vivo, the {cDNA} of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ({DNBS})-colitis in mice.
Results The seven peptides, identified in the F. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule ({MAM}), a protein of 15 {kDa}, and comprising 53\% of non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of {MAM}-derived peptides. Transfection of {MAM} {cDNA} in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor ({NF})-κB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding {MAM} was able to alleviate {DNBS}-induced colitis in mice.
Conclusions A 15 {kDa} protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in {CD} pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit the {NF}-κB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.},

	abstract = {Reconstruction of the molecular pathways controlling organ development has been hampered by a lack of methods to resolve embryonic progenitor cells. Here we describe a strategy to address this problem that combines gene expression profiling of large numbers of single cells with data analysis based on diffusion maps for dimensionality reduction and network synthesis from state transition graphs. Applying the approach to hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo, we map the progression of mesoderm toward blood using single-cell gene expression analysis of 3,934 cells with blood-forming potential captured at four time points between E7.0 and E8.5. Transitions between individual cellular states are then used as input to develop a single-cell network synthesis toolkit to generate a computationally executable transcriptional regulatory network model of blood development. Several model predictions concerning the roles of Sox and Hox factors are validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analysis of a developing organ coupled with computational approaches can reveal the transcriptional programs that underpin organogenesis.

Using two deeply sequenced data sets for human {RNA} polymerase {II} and {STAT}1, each with matching input-{DNA} controls, we describe a general scoring approach to address unique challenges in {ChIP}-seq data analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that sites of potential binding are strongly correlated with signal peaks in the control, likely revealing features of open chromatin. We develop a two-pass strategy called {PeakSeq} to compensate for this. A two-pass strategy compensates for signal caused by open chromatin, as revealed by inclusion of the controls. The first pass identifies putative binding sites and compensates for genomic variation in the 'mappability' of sequences. The second pass filters out sites not significantly enriched compared to the normalized control, computing precise enrichments and significances. Our scoring procedure enables us to optimize experimental design by estimating the depth of sequencing required for a desired level of coverage and demonstrating that more than two replicates provides only a marginal gain in information.},

The oral microbiome is comprised of over 600 prevalent taxa at the species level, with distinct subsets predominating at different habitats. The oral microbiome has been extensively characterized by cultivation and culture-independent molecular methods such as 16S {rRNA} cloning. Unfortunately, the vast majority of unnamed oral taxa are referenced by clone numbers or 16S {rRNA} {GenBank} accession numbers, often without taxonomic anchors. The first aim of this research was to collect 16S {rRNA} gene sequences into a curated phylogeny-based database, the Human Oral Microbiome Database ({HOMD}), and make it web accessible (www.homd.org). The {HOMD} includes 619 taxa in 13 phyla, as follows: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, {SR}1, Synergistetes, Tenericutes, and {TM}7. The second aim was to analyze 36,043 16S {rRNA} gene clones isolated from studies of the oral microbiota to determine the relative abundance of taxa and identify novel candidate taxa. The analysis identified 1,179 taxa, of which 24\% were named, 8\% were cultivated but unnamed, and 68\% were uncultivated phylotypes. Upon validation, 434 novel, nonsingleton taxa will be added to the {HOMD}. The number of taxa needed to account for 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% of the clones examined is 259, 413, and 875, respectively. The {HOMD} is the first curated description of a human-associated microbiome and provides tools for use in understanding the role of the microbiome in health and disease.},

We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and {DNA} isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 {OTUs} (0.3\% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.},

However, higher raw read error rates are an intrinsic drawback in most {TGS} technologies. Here we present a computational method, {LSC}, to perform error correction of {TGS} long reads ({LR}) by {SGS} short reads ({SR}). Aiming to reduce the error rate in homopolymer runs in the main {TGS} platform, the {PacBio}® {\textless}italic{\textgreater}{RS}{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, {LSC} applies a homopolymer compression ({HC}) transformation strategy to increase the sensitivity of {SR}-{LR} alignment without scarifying alignment accuracy. We applied {LSC} to 100,000 {PacBio} long reads from human brain cerebellum {RNA}-seq data and 64 million single-end 75 bp reads from human brain {RNA}-seq data. The results show {LSC} can correct {PacBio} long reads to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds. The improved accuracy greatly benefits many downstream analyses, such as directional gene isoform detection in {RNA}-seq study. Compared with another hybrid correction tool, {LSC} can achieve over double the sensitivity and similar specificity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing of {PCR}-amplified fragments that target variable regions within the 16S {rRNA} gene has quickly become a powerful method for analyzing the membership and structure of microbial communities. This approach has revealed and introduced questions that were not fully appreciated by those carrying out traditional Sanger sequencing-based methods. These include the effects of alignment quality, the best method of calculating pairwise genetic distances for 16S {rRNA} genes, whether it is appropriate to filter variable regions, and how the choice of variable region relates to the genetic diversity observed in full-length sequences. I used a diverse collection of 13,501 high-quality full-length sequences to assess each of these questions. First, alignment quality had a significant impact on distance values and downstream analyses. Specifically, the greengenes alignment, which does a poor job of aligning variable regions, predicted higher genetic diversity, richness, and phylogenetic diversity than the {SILVA} and {RDP}-based alignments. Second, the effect of different gap treatments in determining pairwise genetic distances was strongly affected by the variation in sequence length for a region; however, the effect of different calculation methods was subtle when determining the sample's richness or phylogenetic diversity for a region. Third, applying a sequence mask to remove variable positions had a profound impact on genetic distances by muting the observed richness and phylogenetic diversity. Finally, the genetic distances calculated for each of the variable regions did a poor job of correlating with the full-length gene. Thus, while it is tempting to apply traditional cutoff levels derived for full-length sequences to these shorter sequences, it is not advisable. Analysis of beta-diversity metrics showed that each of these factors can have a significant impact on the comparison of community membership and structure. Taken together, these results urge caution in the design and interpretation of analyses using pyrosequencing data.},

The relationship between {BFT} isoform and disease expression is unknown. Although the mechanism of action of {BFT} is incompletely understood, available data suggest that {BFT} binds to a specific intestinal epithelial cell receptor, stimulating intestinal cell signal transduction pathways that result in cell morphology changes, cleavage of E-cadherin, reduced colonic barrier function, and increased epithelial cell proliferation and cytokine expression (such as the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8). Together, the data suggest that in some hosts, {ETBF} acts via secretion of {BFT} to induce colitis. However, the full spectrum of clinical disease related to {ETBF} and the impact of chronic {ETBF} colonization on the host remain to be defined.},

	abstract = {The human oral cavity contains a number of different habitats, including the teeth, gingival sulcus, tongue, cheeks, hard and soft palates, and tonsils, which are colonized by bacteria. The oral microbiome is comprised of over 600 prevalent taxa at the species level, with distinct subsets predominating at different habitats. The oral microbiome has been extensively characterized by cultivation and culture-independent molecular methods such as 16S {rRNA} cloning. Unfortunately, the vast majority of unnamed oral taxa are referenced by clone numbers or 16S {rRNA} {GenBank} accession numbers, often without taxonomic anchors. The first aim of this research was to collect 16S {rRNA} gene sequences into a curated phylogeny-based database, the Human Oral Microbiome Database ({HOMD}), and make it web accessible (www.homd.org). The {HOMD} includes 619 taxa in 13 phyla, as follows: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, {SR}1, Synergistetes, Tenericutes, and {TM}7. The second aim was to analyze 36,043 16S {rRNA} gene clones isolated from studies of the oral microbiota to determine the relative abundance of taxa and identify novel candidate taxa. The analysis identified 1,179 taxa, of which 24\% were named, 8\% were cultivated but unnamed, and 68\% were uncultivated phylotypes. Upon validation, 434 novel, nonsingleton taxa will be added to the {HOMD}. The number of taxa needed to account for 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% of the clones examined is 259, 413, and 875, respectively. The {HOMD} is the first curated description of a human-associated microbiome and provides tools for use in understanding the role of the microbiome in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to largely gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole-genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly nonuniform read coverage and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler {SPAdes} to a new approach for capturing and sequencing "microbial dark matter" that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. On single-cell bacterial datasets, {SPAdes} improves on the recently developed E+V-{SC} and {IDBA}-{UD} assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (cultivated monostrain) datasets, {SPAdes} also improves on A5, {ABySS}, {CLC}, {EULER}-{SR}, Ray, {SOAPdenovo}, and Velvet. Thus, recently developed single-cell assemblers not only enable single-cell sequencing, but also improve on conventional assemblers on their own turf. {SPAdes} is available for free online download under a {GPLv}2 license.},

On the Roche 454 we analyzed the {\textasciitilde}500 bp amplicons. Error rates associated with the isolate were lowest with the Roche 454 method (2\%), increased by more than 2-fold for the 500 bp amplicons with the {PacBio} {SMRT} chip (4-5\%), and by more than 8-fold for the full gene with the {PacBio} {SMRT} chip (17-18\%). Higher error rates with the {PacBio} {SMRT} chip artificially inflated estimates of richness and lowered estimates of coverage for environmental samples.

Treating naive mice with a metabolite that is increased by {MIA} and restored by B. fragilis causes certain behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that gut bacterial effects on the host metabolome impact behavior. Taken together, these findings support a gut-microbiome-brain connection in a mouse model of {ASD} and identify a potential probiotic therapy for {GI} and particular behavioral symptoms in human neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {16S ribosomal {RNA} currently represents the most important target of study in bacterial ecology. Its use for the description of bacterial diversity is, however, limited by the presence of variable copy numbers in bacterial genomes and sequence variation within closely related taxa or within a genome. Here we use the information from sequenced bacterial genomes to explore the variability of 16S {rRNA} sequences and copy numbers at various taxonomic levels and apply it to estimate bacterial genome and {DNA} abundances. In total, 7,081 16S {rRNA} sequences were in silico extracted from 1,690 available bacterial genomes (1-15 per genome). While there are several phyla containing low 16S {rRNA} copy numbers, in certain taxa, e.g., the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, the variation is large. Genome sizes are more conserved at all tested taxonomic levels than 16S {rRNA} copy numbers. Only a minority of bacterial genomes harbors identical 16S {rRNA} gene copies, and sequence diversity increases with increasing copy numbers. While certain taxa harbor dissimilar 16S {rRNA} genes, others contain sequences common to multiple species. Sequence identity clusters (often termed operational taxonomic units) thus provide an imperfect representation of bacterial taxa of a certain phylogenetic rank. We have demonstrated that the information on 16S {rRNA} copy numbers and genome sizes of genome-sequenced bacteria may be used as an estimate for the closest related taxon in an environmental dataset to calculate alternative estimates of the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa in environmental samples. Using an example from forest soil, this procedure would increase the abundance estimates of Acidobacteria and decrease these of Firmicutes. Using the currently available information, alternative estimates of bacterial community composition may be obtained in this way if the variation of 16S {rRNA} copy numbers among bacteria is considered.},

We compared the skin microbiome at the strain level and genome level of Propionibacterium acnes, a dominant skin commensal, between 49 acne patients and 52 healthy individuals by sampling the pilosebaceous units on their noses. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that although the relative abundances of P. acnes were similar, the strain population structures were significantly different in the two cohorts. Certain strains were highly associated with acne, and other strains were enriched in healthy skin. By sequencing 66 previously unreported P. acnes strains and comparing 71 P. acnes genomes, we identified potential genetic determinants of various P. acnes strains in association with acne or health. Our analysis suggests that acquired {DNA} sequences and bacterial immune elements may have roles in determining virulence properties of P. acnes strains, and some could be future targets for therapeutic interventions. This study demonstrates a previously unreported paradigm of commensal strain populations that could explain the pathogenesis of human diseases. It underscores the importance of strain-level analysis of the human microbiome to define the role of commensals in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Humans are colonized by multitudes of commensal organisms representing members of five of the six kingdoms of life; however, our gastrointestinal tract provides residence to both beneficial and potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Imbalances in the composition of the bacterial microbiota, known as dysbiosis, are postulated to be a major factor in human disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We report here that the prominent human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis protects animals from experimental colitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus, a commensal bacterium with pathogenic potential. This beneficial activity requires a single microbial molecule (polysaccharide A, {PSA}). In animals harbouring B. fragilis not expressing {PSA}, H. hepaticus colonization leads to disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in colonic tissues. Purified {PSA} administered to animals is required to suppress pro-inflammatory interleukin-17 production by intestinal immune cells and also inhibits in vitro reactions in cell cultures. Furthermore, {PSA} protects from inflammatory disease through a functional requirement for interleukin-10-producing {CD}4+ T cells. These results show that molecules of the bacterial microbiota can mediate the critical balance between health and disease. Harnessing the immunomodulatory capacity of symbiosis factors such as {PSA} might potentially provide therapeutics for human inflammatory disorders on the basis of entirely novel biological principles.},

	abstract = {The recent introduction of massively parallel pyrosequencers allows rapid, inexpensive analysis of microbial community composition using 16S ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}) sequences. However, a major challenge is to design a workflow so that taxonomic information can be accurately and rapidly assigned to each read, so that the composition of each community can be linked back to likely ecological roles played by members of each species, genus, family or phylum. Here, we use three large 16S {rRNA} datasets to test whether taxonomic information based on the full-length sequences can be recaptured by short reads that simulate the pyrosequencer outputs. We find that different taxonomic assignment methods vary radically in their ability to recapture the taxonomic information in full-length 16S {rRNA} sequences: most methods are sensitive to the region of the 16S {rRNA} gene that is targeted for sequencing, but many combinations of methods and {rRNA} regions produce consistent and accurate results. To process large datasets of partial 16S {rRNA} sequences obtained from surveys of various microbial communities, including those from human body habitats, we recommend the use of Greengenes or {RDP} classifier with fragments of at least 250 bases, starting from one of the primers R357, R534, R798, F343 or F517.},

We now extend our previous observations on the role of commensal bacteria in {CNS} demyelination, and we demonstrate that Bacteroides fragilis producing a bacterial capsular polysaccharide Ag can protect against {EAE}. Recolonization with wild type B. fragilis maintained resistance to {EAE}, whereas reconstitution with polysaccharide A-deficient B. fragilis restored {EAE} susceptibility. Enhanced numbers of Foxp3(+)T(reg) cells in the cervical lymph nodes were observed after intestinal recolonization with either strain of B. fragilis. Ex vivo, {CD}4(+)T cells obtained from mice reconstituted with wild type B. fragilis had significantly enhanced rates of conversion into {IL}-10-producing Foxp3(+)T(reg) cells and offered greater protection against disease.

To determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) Clinical Center patient population and hospital environment. We isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding Enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Pantoea species. Long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. We did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and C. freundii in the hospital environment. Our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. In addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by K. pneumoniae, E. coli, E. cloacae, and Pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.},

However, results from different studies using pyrosequencing and traditional sequencing are often difficult to compare, because amplicons covering different regions of the {rRNA} might yield different conclusions. We used sequences from over 200 globally dispersed environments to test whether studies that used similar primers clustered together mistakenly, without regard to environment. We then tested whether primer choice affects sequence-based community analyses using {UniFrac}, our recently-developed method for comparing microbial communities. We performed three tests of primer effects. We tested whether different simulated amplicons generated the same {UniFrac} clustering results as near-full-length sequences for three recent large-scale studies of microbial communities in the mouse and human gut, and the Guerrero Negro microbial mat. We then repeated this analysis for short sequences (100-, 150-, 200- and 250-base reads) resembling those produced by pyrosequencing. The results show that sequencing effort is best focused on gathering more short sequences rather than fewer longer ones, provided that the primers are chosen wisely, and that community comparison methods such as {UniFrac} are surprisingly robust to variation in the region sequenced.},

Although metagenomic sequencing has enabled the de novo reconstruction of some microbial genomes from environmental communities, microdiversity confounds current genome reconstruction techniques. To overcome this issue, we performed short-read metagenomic sequencing on parallel consortia, defined as consortia cultivated under the same conditions from the same natural community with overlapping species composition. The differences in species abundance between the two consortia allowed reconstruction of near-complete (est. {\textgreater}85\% of gene complement) genome sequences for 17 of the 20 detected member species. Two Halomonas spp. indistinguishable by amplicon analysis were found to be present within the community. In addition, comparison of metagenomic reads against the consensus scaffolds revealed within-species variation for one of the Halomonas populations, one of the Rhodobacteraceae populations, and the Rhizobiales population. Genomic comparison of these representative instances of inter- and intraspecies microdiversity suggests differences in functional potential that may result in expression of distinct roles in the community. In addition, isolation and complete genome sequence determination of six member species allowed an investigation into the sensitivity and specificity of genome reconstruction processes, demonstrating robustness across a wide range of sequence coverage (9x – 2700x) within the metagenomic dataset.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate very large numbers of short reads. Even with very deep genome coverage, short read lengths cause problems in de novo assemblies. The use of paired-end libraries with a fragment size shorter than twice the read length provides an opportunity to generate much longer reads by overlapping and merging read pairs before assembling a genome.
Results: We present {FLASH}, a fast computational tool to extend the length of short reads by overlapping paired-end reads from fragment libraries that are sufficiently short. We tested the correctness of the tool on one million simulated read pairs, and we then applied it as a pre-processor for genome assemblies of Illumina reads from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and human chromosome 14. {FLASH} correctly extended and merged reads {\textgreater}99\% of the time on simulated reads with an error rate of {\textless}1\%. With adequately set parameters, {FLASH} correctly merged reads over 90\% of the time even when the reads contained up to 5\% errors. When {FLASH} was used to extend reads prior to assembly, the resulting assemblies had substantially greater N50 lengths for both contigs and scaffolds.
Availability and Implementation: The {FLASH} system is implemented in C and is freely available as open-source code at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/flash.

The uncultivated taxa are known primarily from 16S {rRNA} sequence information. Sequence information tied solely to obscure isolate or clone numbers, and usually lacking accurate phylogenetic placement, is a major impediment to working with human oral microbiome data. The goal of creating the Human Oral Microbiome Database ({HOMD}) is to provide the scientific community with a body site-specific comprehensive database for the more than 600 prokaryote species that are present in the human oral cavity based on a curated 16S {rRNA} gene-based provisional naming scheme. Currently, two primary types of information are provided in {HOMD}--taxonomic and genomic. Named oral species and taxa identified from 16S {rRNA} gene sequence analysis of oral isolates and cloning studies were placed into defined 16S {rRNA} phylotypes and each given unique Human Oral Taxon ({HOT}) number. The {HOT} interlinks phenotypic, phylogenetic, genomic, clinical and bibliographic information for each taxon. A {BLAST} search tool is provided to match user 16S {rRNA} gene sequences to a curated, full length, 16S {rRNA} gene reference data set. For genomic analysis, {HOMD} provides comprehensive set of analysis tools and maintains frequently updated annotations for all the human oral microbial genomes that have been sequenced and publicly released. Oral bacterial genome sequences, determined as part of the Human Microbiome Project, are being added to the {HOMD} as they become available.

In the context of gastrointestinal disease, the bacterium enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis ({ETBF}) is a significant source of chronic inflammation and has been implicated as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Spermine oxidase ({SMO}) is a polyamine catabolic enzyme that is highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli resulting in increased reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and {DNA} damage. We now demonstrate that purified B. fragilis toxin ({BFT}) up-regulates {SMO} in {HT}29/c1 and T84 colonic epithelial cells, resulting in {SMO}-dependent generation of {ROS} and induction of γ-H2A.x, a marker of {DNA} damage. Further, {ETBF}-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice is associated with increased {SMO} expression and treatment of mice with an inhibitor of polyamine catabolism, N(1),N(4)-bis(2,3-butandienyl)-1,4-butanediamine ({MDL} 72527), significantly reduces {ETBF}-induced chronic inflammation and proliferation. Most importantly, in the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse model, treatment with {MDL} 72527 reduces {ETBF}-induced colon tumorigenesis by 69\% (P {\textless} 0.001). The results of these studies indicate that {SMO} is a source of bacteria-induced {ROS} directly associated with tumorigenesis and could serve as a unique target for chemoprevention.},

In mice and patients, T cell responses specific for B. thetaiotaomicron or B. fragilis were associated with the efficacy of {CTLA}-4 blockade. Tumors in antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice did not respond to {CTLA} blockade. This defect was overcome by gavage with B. fragilis, by immunization with B. fragilis polysaccharides, or by adoptive transfer of B. fragilis-specific T cells. Fecal microbial transplantation from humans to mice confirmed that treatment of melanoma patients with antibodies against {CTLA}-4 favored the outgrowth of B. fragilis with anticancer properties. This study reveals a key role for Bacteroidales in the immunostimulatory effects of {CTLA}-4 blockade.},

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence ({\textgreater} or = 95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the {RDP} Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 {rRNA} sequences as assigned by the {NCBI} into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter {rRNA} segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S {rRNA} gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The {RDP} Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single {rRNA} sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, {RDP} Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S {rRNA} gene sequence libraries. It combines the {RDP} Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples.

	abstract = {Background
High-throughput bacterial 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing followed by clustering of short sequences into operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) is widely used for microbiome profiling. However, clustering of short 16S {rRNA} gene reads into biologically meaningful {OTUs} is challenging, in part because nucleotide variation along the 16S {rRNA} gene is only partially captured by short reads. The recent emergence of long-read platforms, such as single-molecule real-time ({SMRT}) sequencing from Pacific Biosciences, offers the potential for improved taxonomic and phylogenetic profiling. Here, we evaluate the performance of long- and short-read 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing using simulated and experimental data, followed by {OTU} inference using computational pipelines based on heuristic and complete-linkage hierarchical clustering.

Results
In simulated data, long-read sequencing was shown to improve {OTU} quality and decrease variance. We then profiled 40 human gut microbiome samples using a combination of Illumina {MiSeq} and Blautia-specific {SMRT} sequencing, further supporting the notion that long reads can identify additional {OTUs}. We implemented a complete-linkage hierarchical clustering strategy using a flexible computational pipeline, tailored specifically for {PacBio} circular consensus sequencing ({CCS}) data that outperforms heuristic methods in most settings: https://github.com/oscar-franzen/oclust/.

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that long reads can improve {OTU} inference; however, the choice of clustering algorithm and associated clustering thresholds has significant impact on performance.

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}) are a powerful tool for modeling both the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model. However, constructing {MSMs} is challenging because doing so requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of {MSMs} called {MSMBUILDER} (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of {MSMBUILDER} to the villin headpiece ({HP}-35 {NleNle}), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting {MSM} captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental validation of our methodology we show that our model provides accurate structure prediction and that the longest timescale events correspond to folding.},

Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence. Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D, and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have major confounding effects. We also applied our model to a recently described Chinese cohort and show that the discriminant metagenomic markers for T2D differ between the European and Chinese cohorts. Therefore, metagenomic predictive tools for T2D should be specific for the age and geographical location of the populations studied.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput {RNA}-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available {RNA}-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) {ENCODE} Transcriptome {RNA}-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference ({STAR}) software based on a previously undescribed {RNA}-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. {STAR} outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, {STAR} can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length {RNA} sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the {STAR} mapping strategy.

We prospectively investigated the association between serum metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics and risk of T2D in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ({EPIC})-Potsdam (27,548 adults) among all incident cases of T2D (n = 800, mean follow-up 7 years) and a randomly drawn subcohort (n = 2,282). Flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 163 metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, hexose, and phospholipids, in baseline serum samples. Serum hexose; phenylalanine; and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:1, C36:1, C38:3, and C40:5 were independently associated with increased risk of T2D and serum glycine; sphingomyelin C16:1; acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines C34:3, C40:6, C42:5, C44:4, and C44:5; and lysophosphatidylcholine C18:2 with decreased risk. Variance of the metabolites was largely explained by two metabolite factors with opposing risk associations (factor 1 relative risk in extreme quintiles 0.31 [95\% {CI} 0.21–0.44], factor 2 3.82 [2.64–5.52]). The metabolites significantly improved T2D prediction compared with established risk factors. They were further linked to insulin sensitivity and secretion in the Tübingen Family study and were partly replicated in the independent {KORA} (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort. The data indicate that metabolic alterations, including sugar metabolites, amino acids, and choline-containing phospholipids, are associated early on with a higher risk of T2D.},

	abstract = {Asthma is prevalent in Western countries, and recent explanations have evoked the actions of the gut microbiota. Here we show that feeding mice a high-fibre diet yields a distinctive gut microbiota, which increases the levels of the short-chain fatty acid, acetate. High-fibre or acetate-feeding led to marked suppression of allergic airways disease ({AAD}, a model for human asthma), by enhancing T-regulatory cell numbers and function. Acetate increases acetylation at the Foxp3 promoter, likely through {HDAC}9 inhibition. Epigenetic effects of fibre/acetate in adult mice led us to examine the influence of maternal intake of fibre/acetate. High-fibre/acetate feeding of pregnant mice imparts on their adult offspring an inability to develop robust {AAD}. High fibre/acetate suppresses expression of certain genes in the mouse fetal lung linked to both human asthma and mouse {AAD}. Thus, diet acting on the gut microbiota profoundly influences airway responses, and may represent an approach to prevent asthma, including during pregnancy.},

Two metabolic sequelae of hyperglycemia in diabetic nerve, sorbitol accumulation via aldose reductase, and (Na,K)-{ATPase} deficiency related to myo-inositol depletion, were explored as possible underlying causes of acute paranodal swelling in the spontaneously diabetic bio-breeding rat. 3 wk of insulin replacement, or therapy with an aldose reductase inhibitor or myo-inositol completely reversed paranodal swelling in sural nerve fibers after 3 wk of untreated insulin deficiency. These observations suggest that insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia cause reversible paranodal swelling, and ultimately poorly reversible axo-glial dysjunction, via the myo-inositol-related (Na,K)-{ATPase} defect rather than by the osmotic effects of sorbitol accumulation within nerve fibers.},

Here, we have used a metabolomics approach to identify candidate biomarkers of pre-diabetes. We quantified 140 metabolites for 4297 fasting serum samples in the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg ({KORA}) cohort. Our study revealed significant metabolic variation in pre-diabetic individuals that are distinct from known diabetes risk indicators, such as glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fasting glucose and insulin. We identified three metabolites (glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine ({LPC}) (18:2) and acetylcarnitine) that had significantly altered levels in {IGT} individuals as compared to those with normal glucose tolerance, with P-values ranging from 2.4×10(-4) to 2.1×10(-13). Lower levels of glycine and {LPC} were found to be predictors not only for {IGT} but also for T2D, and were independently confirmed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ({EPIC})-Potsdam cohort. Using metabolite-protein network analysis, we identified seven T2D-related genes that are associated with these three {IGT}-specific metabolites by multiple interactions with four enzymes. The expression levels of these enzymes correlate with changes in the metabolite concentrations linked to diabetes. Our results may help developing novel strategies to prevent T2D.},

We investigated this by developing a hitting set-based coding algorithm and applying it to the Human Microbiome Project population. Our approach defined body site-specific metagenomic codes: sets of microbial taxa or genes prioritized to uniquely and stably identify individuals. Codes capturing strain variation in clade-specific marker genes were able to distinguish among 100s of individuals at an initial sampling time point. In comparisons with follow-up samples collected 30–300 d later, ∼30\% of individuals could still be uniquely pinpointed using metagenomic codes from a typical body site; coincidental (false positive) matches were rare. Codes based on the gut microbiome were exceptionally stable and pinpointed {\textgreater}80\% of individuals. The failure of a code to match its owner at a later time point was largely explained by the loss of specific microbial strains (at current limits of detection) and was only weakly associated with the length of the sampling interval. In addition to highlighting patterns of temporal variation in the ecology of the human microbiome, this work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome-based identifiability—a result with important ethical implications for microbiome study design.

	abstract = {Glucocorticosteroids are used as a main treatment to reduce airway inflammation in people with asthma who suffer from neutrophilic airway inflammation, a condition frequently associated with Haemophilus influenzae colonization. Here we show that glucocorticosteroids have a direct influence on the behavior of H. influenzae that may account for associated difficulties with therapy. Using a mouse model of infection, we show that corticosteroid treatment promotes H. influenzae persistence. Transcriptomic analysis of bacteria either isolated from infected mouse airway or grown in laboratory medium identified a number of genes encoding regulatory factors whose expression responded to the presence of glucocorticosteroids. Importantly, a number of these corticosteroid-responsive genes also showed elevated expression in H. influenzae within sputum from asthma patients undergoing steroid treatment. Addition of corticosteroid to H. influenzae led to alteration in biofilm formation and enhanced resistance to azithromycin, and promoted azithromycin resistance in an animal model of respiratory infection. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that H. influenzae can respond directly to corticosteroid treatment in the airway potentially influencing biofilm formation, persistence and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment.},

	abstract = {In Argentina, more than 3 million people suffer from asthma, with numbers rising. When asthma patients acquire viral infections which, in turn, trigger the asthmatic response, they may develop subsequent bacterial infections, mainly by Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. This encapsulated Gram(+) bacterium has been considered historically a T cell-independent antigen. Nevertheless, several papers describe the role of T cells in the immune response to S. pneumoniae. We evaluated the response to S. pneumoniae and compared it to the response to Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis, a different type of bacterium that requires a T helper type 1 (Th1) response, in cells from atopic asthmatic children, to compare parameters for the same individual under exacerbation and in a stable situation whenever possible. We studied asthma patients and a control group of age-matched children, evaluating cell populations, activation markers and cytokine production by flow cytometry, and cytokine concentration in serum and cell culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}). No differences were observed in γδ T cells for the same patient in either situation, and a tendency to lower percentages of {CD}4(+) {CD}25(hi) T cells was observed under stability. A significantly lower production of tumour necrosis factor ({TNF})-α and a significantly higher production of interleukin ({IL})-5 was observed in asthma patients compared to healthy individuals, but no differences could be observed for {IL}-4, {IL}-13 or {IL}-10. A greater early activation response against M. tuberculosis, compared to S. pneumoniae, was observed in the asthmatic patients' cells. This may contribute to explaining why these patients frequently acquire infections caused by the latter bacterium and not the former.},

Changes in the gut microbiota have been implicated in the development of asthma in animal models; however, it has remained unclear whether these findings hold true in humans. Now, Arrieta et al. report in a longitudinal human study that infants at risk of asthma have transient gut microbial dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. They found that certain bacterial genera were decreased in these children. Moreover, adding these bacteria back to germ-free mice decreased airway inflammation, suggesting a potential causative role of the loss of these microbes. They suggest a window where microbe-based diagnostics and therapeutics may be useful to prevent the development of asthma in high-risk individuals.
Asthma is the most prevalent pediatric chronic disease and affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Recent evidence in mice has identified a “critical window” early in life where gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) are most influential in experimental asthma. However, current research has yet to establish whether these changes precede or are involved in human asthma. We compared the gut microbiota of 319 subjects enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development ({CHILD}) Study, and show that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. The relative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. This reduction in bacterial taxa was accompanied by reduced levels of fecal acetate and dysregulation of enterohepatic metabolites. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these four bacterial taxa ameliorated airway inflammation in their adult progeny, demonstrating a causal role of these bacterial taxa in averting asthma development. These results enhance the potential for future microbe-based diagnostics and therapies, potentially in the form of probiotics, to prevent the development of asthma and other related allergic diseases in children.
Supplementing bacterial genera reduced in infants at high risk for asthma ameliorates lung inflammation in mice.

	abstract = {Background
The prevalence of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. The objective of this review and meta-analysis is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes in association with the procedure performed and the weight reduction achieved.
Methods
The review includes all articles published in English from January 1, 1990, to April 30, 2006.
Results
The dataset includes 621 studies with 888 treatment arms and 135,246 patients; 103 treatment arms with 3188 patients reported on resolution of diabetes, that is, the resolution of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of type 2 diabetes. Nineteen studies with 43 treatment arms and 11,175 patients reported both weight loss and diabetes resolution separately for the 4070 diabetic patients in these studies. At baseline, the mean age was 40.2 years, body mass index was 47.9 kg/m2, 80\% were female, and 10.5\% had previous bariatric procedures. Meta-analysis of weight loss overall was 38.5 kg or 55.9\% excess body weight loss. Overall, 78.1\% of diabetic patients had complete resolution, and diabetes was improved or resolved in 86.6\% of patients. Weight loss and diabetes resolution were greatest for patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch, followed by gastric bypass, and least for banding procedures. Insulin levels declined significantly postoperatively, as did hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose values. Weight and diabetes parameters showed little difference at less than 2 years and at 2 years or more.
Conclusion
The clinical and laboratory manifestations of type 2 diabetes are resolved or improved in the greater majority of patients after bariatric surgery; these responses are more pronounced in procedures associated with a greater percentage of excess body weight loss and is maintained for 2 years or more.},

	abstract = {Rationale The role bacteria play in the progression of {COPD} has increasingly been highlighted in recent years. However, the microbial community complexity in the lower airways of patients with {COPD} is poorly characterised.
Objectives To compare the lower airway microbiota in patients with {COPD}, smokers and non-smokers.
Methods Bronchial wash samples from adults with {COPD} (n=18), smokers with no airways disease (n=8) and healthy individuals (n=11) were analysed by extended-culture and culture-independent Illumina {MiSeq} sequencing. We determined aerobic and anaerobic microbiota load and evaluated differences in bacteria associated with the three cohorts. Culture-independent analysis was used to determine differences in microbiota between comparison groups including taxonomic richness, diversity, relative abundance, ‘core’ microbiota and co-occurrence.
Measurement and main results Extended-culture showed no difference in total load of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria between the three cohorts. Culture-independent analysis revealed that the prevalence of members of Pseudomonas spp. was greater in the lower airways of patients with {COPD}; however, the majority of the sequence reads for this taxa were attributed to three patients. Furthermore, members of Bacteroidetes, such as Prevotella spp., were observed to be greater in the ‘healthy’ comparison groups. Community diversity (α and β) was significantly less in {COPD} compared with healthy groups. Co-occurrence of bacterial taxa and the observation of a putative ‘core’ community within the lower airways were also observed.
Conclusions Microbial community composition in the lower airways of patients with {COPD} is significantly different to that found in smokers and non-smokers, indicating that a component of the disease is associated with changes in microbiological status.},

Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles.},

Ribosomal {DNA} sequences, together with protein-coding genes ({RPB}2, {EF}1α), growth rates and morphology, were used for species delimitation and description. Ecological data gathered by this and previous studies and the inclusion of sequences deposited in public databases show that Biatriospora contains species that are endophytes of angiosperms in temperate and tropical regions as well as species that live in marine or estuarine environments. These findings show that this genus is more diverse and has more host associations than has been described previously. The possible adaptations enabling the broad ecological range of these fungi are discussed. Due to the importance that Biatriospora species have in bioprospecting natural products, we suggest that the species introduced here warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {In densely populated urban environments, the distribution of microbes and the drivers of microbial community assemblages are not well understood. In sprawling metropolitan habitats, the “urban microbiome” may represent a mix of human-associated and environmental taxa. Here we carried out a baseline study of automated teller machine ({ATM}) keypads in New York City ({NYC}). Our goal was to describe the biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of microbial assemblages on {ATM} keypads. Microbial swab samples were collected from three boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during June and July 2014, followed by generation of Illumina {MiSeq} datasets for bacterial (16S {rRNA}) and eukaryotic (18S {rRNA}) marker genes. Downstream analysis was carried out in the {QIIME} pipeline, in conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age groups) from the {NYC} Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S {rRNA} datasets showed any clustering patterns related to geography or neighborhood demographics. Bacterial assemblages on {ATM} keypads were dominated by taxonomic groups known to be associated with human skin communities (Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), although {SourceTracker} analysis was unable to identify the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist community containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa (Toxoplasma, Trichomonas). Our results suggest that {ATM} keypads amalgamate microbial assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome, eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa adapted to air or surfaces in the built environment. {DNA} obtained from {ATM} keypads may thus provide a record of both human behavior and environmental sources of microbes.
{IMPORTANCE} Automated teller machine ({ATM}) keypads represent a specific and unexplored microhabitat for microbial communities. Although the number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings. {ATM} surfaces, potentially retaining microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both commensal taxa and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity perspective and a public health perspective. By focusing on {ATM} keypads in different geographic areas of New York City with distinct population demographics, we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution to the growing body of work focused on the “urban microbiome.” In New York City, the surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far exceeds the geographic area of the island itself. We have only just begun to describe the vast array of microbial taxa that are likely to be present across diverse types of urban habitats.

	abstract = {With the development of next generation sequencing technology, researchers have now been able to study the microbiome composition using direct sequencing, whose output are bacterial taxa counts for each microbiome sample. One goal of microbiome study is to associate the microbiome composition with environmental covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts using a Dirichlet-multinomial ({DM}) regression model in order to account for overdispersion of observed counts. The {DM} regression model can be used for testing the association between taxa composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test. However, when the number of the covariates is large, multiple testing can lead to loss of power. To deal with the high dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized likelihood approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the variables by imposing a sparse group ℓ1 penalty to encourage both group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a variable selection procedure can lead to selection of the relevant covariates and their associated bacterial taxa. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. We present extensive simulations to demonstrate that the sparse {DM} regression can result in better identification of the microbiome-associated covariates than models that ignore overdispersion or only consider the proportions. We demonstrate the power of our method in an analysis of a data set evaluating the effects of nutrient intake on human gut microbiome composition. Our results have clearly shown that the nutrient intake is strongly associated with the human gut microbiome.},

We used pyrosequencing of 16S amplicons to analyze the lung microbiome in two ways: first, using bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL}) to sample the distal bronchi and air-spaces; and second, by examining multiple discrete tissue sites in the lungs of six subjects removed at the time of transplantation. We performed {BAL} on three never-smokers ({NS}) with normal spirometry, seven smokers with normal spirometry (“heathy smokers”, {HS}), and four subjects with {COPD} ({CS}). Bacterial 16 s sequences were found in all subjects, without significant quantitative differences between groups. Both taxonomy-based and taxonomy-independent approaches disclosed heterogeneity in the bacterial communities between {HS} subjects that was similar to that seen in healthy {NS} and two mild {COPD} patients. The moderate and severe {COPD} patients had very limited community diversity, which was also noted in 28\% of the healthy subjects. Both approaches revealed extensive membership overlap between the bacterial communities of the three study groups. No genera were common within a group but unique across groups. Our data suggests the existence of a core pulmonary bacterial microbiome that includes Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Porphyromonas. Most strikingly, there were significant micro-anatomic differences in bacterial communities within the same lung of subjects with advanced {COPD}. These studies are further demonstration of the pulmonary microbiome and highlight global and micro-anatomic changes in these bacterial communities in severe {COPD} patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Asthma is heterogeneous, and airway dysbiosis is associated with clinical features in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. Whether similar relationships exist among patients with severe asthma is unknown.
{OBJECTIVE}: We sought to evaluate relationships between the bronchial microbiome and features of severe asthma.
{METHODS}: Bronchial brushings from 40 participants in the Bronchoscopic Exploratory Research Study of Biomarkers in Corticosteroid-refractory Asthma ({BOBCAT}) study were evaluated by using 16S ribosomal {RNA}-based methods. Relationships to clinical and inflammatory features were analyzed among microbiome-profiled subjects. Secondarily, bacterial compositional profiles were compared between patients with severe asthma and previously studied healthy control subjects (n = 7) and patients with mild-to-moderate asthma (n = 41).
{RESULTS}: In patients with severe asthma, bronchial bacterial composition was associated with several disease-related features, including body mass index (P {\textless} .05, Bray-Curtis distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of variance; {PERMANOVA}), changes in Asthma Control Questionnaire ({ACQ}) scores (P {\textless} .01), sputum total leukocyte values (P = .06), and bronchial biopsy eosinophil values (per square millimeter, P = .07). Bacterial communities associated with worsening {ACQ} scores and sputum total leukocyte values (predominantly Proteobacteria) differed markedly from those associated with body mass index (Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes). In contrast, improving/stable {ACQ} scores and bronchial epithelial gene expression of {FK}506 binding protein ({FKBP}5), an indicator of steroid responsiveness, correlated with Actinobacteria. Mostly negative correlations were observed between biopsy eosinophil values and Proteobacteria. No taxa were associated with a {TH}2-related epithelial gene expression signature, but expression of {TH}17-related genes was associated with Proteobacteria. Patients with severe asthma compared with healthy control subjects or patients with mild-to-moderate asthma were significantly enriched in Actinobacteria, although the largest differences observed involved a Klebsiella genus member (7.8-fold increase in patients with severe asthma, adjusted P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Specific microbiota are associated with and may modulate inflammatory processes in patients with severe asthma and related phenotypes. Airway dysbiosis in patients with severe asthma appears to differ from that observed in those with milder asthma in the setting of inhaled corticosteroid use.},

{OBJECTIVES}: To compare the microbiome of the upper and lower respiratory tract in healthy {HIV}-uninfected nonsmokers and smokers in a multicenter cohort.
{METHODS}: Participants were nonsmokers and smokers without significant comorbidities. Oral washes and bronchoscopic alveolar lavages were collected in a standardized manner. Sequence analysis of bacterial 16S {rRNA}-encoding genes was performed, and the neutral model in community ecology was used to identify bacteria that were the most plausible members of a lung microbiome.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Sixty-four participants were enrolled. Most bacteria identified in the lung were also in the mouth, but specific bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, Methylobacterium, and Ralstonia species were disproportionally represented in the lungs compared with values predicted by the neutral model. Tropheryma was also in the lung, but not the mouth. Mouth communities differed between nonsmokers and smokers in species such as Porphyromonas, Neisseria, and Gemella, but lung bacterial populations did not.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study is the largest to examine composition of the lower respiratory tract microbiome in healthy individuals and the first to use the neutral model to compare the lung to the mouth. Specific bacteria appear in significantly higher abundance in the lungs than would be expected if they originated from the mouth, demonstrating that the lung microbiome does not derive entirely from the mouth. The mouth microbiome differs in nonsmokers and smokers, but lung communities were not significantly altered by smoking.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Lung disease in cystic fibrosis ({CF}) results from chronic airway infection and inflammation leading to progressive bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. Bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia, are known contributors. Recent studies using culture-independent molecular techniques and anaerobic cultures have broadened our view of {CF} airway bacterial communities.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Sanger sequencing, high-throughput pyrosequencing, and phylogenetic microarray analysis have been used to comprehensively examine the airway microbiome in {CF}. Findings confirm that {CF} airway bacterial communities are highly complex structures with anaerobes frequently present. Importantly, there is evidence that loss of community diversity and richness is associated with older age and decreased lung function in {CF}. Bacterial communities are also likely influenced by antibiotic use, chronic P. aeruginosa infection, host genetic background (ΔF508 {CFTR} mutation) and geographic variations. Quantitative anaerobic cultures also detect high quantities of anaerobes from {CF} airway samples, including during pulmonary exacerbations. The effect of antimicrobial therapy on the airway microbiome needs further investigation. In addition, probiotic approaches have been recently studied; whether probiotics act by altering microbial communities or by modulating host inflammatory response is unknown.
{SUMMARY}: Complex bacterial communities, including traditional {CF}-associated pathogens and anaerobic bacteria, are common in {CF} airways. Novel therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating airway bacterial communities may lead to improved treatment of {CF} lung disease.},

	abstract = {In densely populated urban environments, the distribution of microbes and the drivers of microbial community assemblages are not well understood. In sprawling metropolitan habitats, the “urban microbiome” may represent a mix of human-associated and environmental taxa. Here we carried out a baseline study of automated teller machine ({ATM}) keypads in New York City ({NYC}). Our goal was to describe the biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of microbial assemblages on {ATM} keypads. Microbial swab samples were collected from three boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during June and July 2014, followed by generation of Illumina {MiSeq} datasets for bacterial (16S {rRNA}) and eukaryotic (18S {rRNA}) marker genes. Downstream analysis was carried out in the {QIIME} pipeline, in conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age groups) from the {NYC} Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S {rRNA} datasets showed any clustering patterns related to geography or neighborhood demographics. Bacterial assemblages on {ATM} keypads were dominated by taxonomic groups known to be associated with human skin communities (Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), although {SourceTracker} analysis was unable to identify the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist community containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa (Toxoplasma, Trichomonas). Our results suggest that {ATM} keypads amalgamate microbial assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome, eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa adapted to air or surfaces in the built environment. {DNA} obtained from {ATM} keypads may thus provide a record of both human behavior and environmental sources of microbes.
{IMPORTANCE} Automated teller machine ({ATM}) keypads represent a specific and unexplored microhabitat for microbial communities. Although the number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings. {ATM} surfaces, potentially retaining microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both commensal taxa and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity perspective and a public health perspective. By focusing on {ATM} keypads in different geographic areas of New York City with distinct population demographics, we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution to the growing body of work focused on the “urban microbiome.” In New York City, the surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far exceeds the geographic area of the island itself. We have only just begun to describe the vast array of microbial taxa that are likely to be present across diverse types of urban habitats.

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput {RNA}-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available {RNA}-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
Results: To align our large (exceeding 80 billon reads) {ENCODE} Transcriptome {RNA}-seq dataset we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference ({STAR}) software based on a previously un-described {RNA}-seq alignment algorithm which utilizes sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. {STAR} outperforms other aligners by more than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 Million 2x76bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, {STAR} can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full length {RNA} sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of {RT}-{PCR} amplicons, we experimentally validated 1,960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the {STAR} mapping strategy.

The main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. This procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. In this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. The computational burden is then alleviated by using the Gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. Those subsets with higher probability—the promising ones—can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the Gibbs sample.},

	abstract = {Elucidation of tumor-{DNA} virus associations in many cancer types has enhanced our knowledge of fundamental oncogenesis mechanisms and provided a basis for cancer prevention initiatives. {RNA}-Seq provides a novel tool to comprehensively assess such associations. We interrogated {RNA}-Seq data from 3775 malignant neoplasms in The Cancer Genome Atlas database for the presence of viral sequences. Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of {RNA}-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) transcripts were detected using {RNA}-Seq analysis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of {HPV} by {RNA}-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus ({EBV}) were detected using {RNA}-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring {HPV} or hepatitis B virus but not in {EBV}-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No {DNA} virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low-and high-grade gliomas of the brain and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney and thyroid. In conclusion, this study provides a large-scale overview of the landscape of {DNA} viruses in human malignant cancers. While further validation is necessary in specific cancer types, our findings highlight the utility of {RNA}-Seq in detecting tumor-associated {DNA} viruses and identifying viral integration sites that may unravel novel mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis.},

In this study, we sought to identify new virus-cancer associations by searching {RNA} sequencing data sets from {\textgreater}2,000 patients, encompassing 21 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), for the presence of viral sequences. In agreement with previous studies, we found human papillomavirus 16 ({HPV}16) and {HPV}18 in oropharyngeal cancer and hepatitis B and C viruses in liver cancer. Unexpectedly, however, we found {HPV}38, a cutaneous form of {HPV} associated with skin cancer, in 32 of 168 samples from endometrial cancer. In 12 of the {HPV}38-positive ({HPV}38+) samples, we observed at least one paired read that mapped to both human and {HPV}38 genomes, indicative of viral integration into the host {DNA}, something not previously demonstrated for {HPV}38. The expression levels of {HPV}38 transcripts were relatively low, and all 32 {HPV}38+ samples belonged to the same experimental batch of 40 samples, whereas none of the other 128 endometrial carcinoma samples were {HPV}38+, raising doubts about the significance of the {HPV}38 association. Moreover, the {HPV}38+ samples contained the same 10 novel single nucleotide variations ({SNVs}), leading us to hypothesize that one patient was infected with this new isolate of {HPV}38, which was integrated into his/her genome and may have cross-contaminated other {TCGA} samples within batch 228. Based on our analysis, we propose guidelines to examine the batch effect, virus expression level, and {SNVs} as part of next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) data analysis for evaluating the significance of viral/pathogen sequences in clinical samples.
{IMPORTANCE} High-throughput {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-Seq), followed by computational analysis, has vastly accelerated the identification of viral and other pathogenic sequences in clinical samples, but cross-contamination during the processing of the samples remain a major problem that can lead to erroneous conclusions. We found {HPV}38 sequences specifically present in {RNA}-Seq samples from endometrial cancer patients from {TCGA}, a virus not previously associated with this type of cancer. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest possible cross-contamination in these samples, which were processed together in the same batch. Despite this potential cross-contamination, our data indicate that we have detected a new isolate of {HPV}38 that appears to be integrated into the human genome. We also provide general guidelines for computational detection and interpretation of pathogen-disease associations.},

The objective of this study was to utilize the capabilities of {NGS} to investigate the reported association between glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) and human cytomegalovirus ({HCMV}). A large-scale comprehensive virome assessment was performed on publicly available sequencing datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), including {RNA}-seq datasets from primary {GBM} (n = 157), recurrent {GBM} (n = 13), low-grade gliomas (n = 514), recurrent low-grade gliomas (n = 17), and normal brain (n = 5), and whole genome sequencing ({WGS}) datasets from primary {GBM} (n = 51), recurrent {GBM} (n = 10), and normal matched blood samples (n = 20). In addition, {RNA}-seq datasets from {MRI}-guided biopsies (n = 92) and glioma stem-like cell cultures (n = 9) were analyzed. Sixty-four {DNA}-seq datasets from 11 meningiomas and their corresponding blood control samples were also analyzed. Finally, three primary {GBM} tissue samples were obtained, sequenced using {RNA}-seq, and analyzed. After in-depth analysis, the most robust virus findings were the detection of papillomavirus ({HPV}) and hepatitis B reads in the occasional {LGG} sample (4 samples and 1 sample, respectively). In addition, low numbers of virus reads were detected in several datasets but detailed investigation of these reads suggest that these findings likely represent artifacts or non-pathological infections. For example, all of the sporadic low level {HCMV} reads were found to map to the immediate early promoter intimating that they likely originated from laboratory expression vector contamination. Despite the detection of low numbers of Epstein-Barr virus reads in some samples, these likely originated from infiltrating B-cells. Finally, human herpesvirus 6 and 7 aligned viral reads were identified in all {DNA}-seq and a few {RNA}-seq datasets but detailed analysis demonstrated that these were likely derived from the homologous human telomeric-like repeats. Other low abundance viral reads were detected in some samples but for most viruses, the reads likely represent artifacts or incidental infections. This analysis argues against associations between most known viruses and {GBM} or mengiomas. Nevertheless, there may be a low percentage association between {HPV} and/or hepatitis B and {LGGs}.},

	abstract = {Academicians have been arguing for decades about whether or not faculty research supports undergraduate instruction. Those who say it does—a group that includes most administrators and faculty members—cite many ways in which research can enrich teaching, while those on the other side cite numerous studies that have consistently failed to show a measurable linkage between the two activities. This article proposes that the two sides are debating different propositions: whether research can support teaching in principle and whether it has been shown to do so in practice. The article reviews the literature on the current state of the research-teaching nexus and then examines three specific strategies for integrating teaching and scholarship: bringing research into the classroom, involving undergraduates in research projects, and broadening the definition of scholarship beyond frontier disciplinary research. Finally, ways are suggested to better realize the potential synergies between faculty research and undergraduate education.},

	abstract = {Gut microbes affect immunotherapy
The unleashing of antitumor T cell responses has ushered in a new era of cancer treatment. Although these therapies can cause dramatic tumor regressions in some patients, many patients inexplicably see no benefit. Mice have been used in two studies to investigate what might be happening. Specific members of the gut microbiota influence the efficacy of this type of immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Snyder et al.). Vétizou et al. found that optimal responses to anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen blockade required specific Bacteroides spp. Similarly, Sivan et al. discovered that Bifidobacterium spp. enhanced the efficacy of antiprogrammed cell death ligand 1 therapy.
Science, this issue, p. 1079 and p. 1084; see also p. 1031
Antibodies targeting {CTLA}-4 have been successfully used as cancer immunotherapy. We find that the antitumor effects of {CTLA}-4 blockade depend on distinct Bacteroides species. In mice and patients, T cell responses specific for B. thetaiotaomicron or B. fragilis were associated with the efficacy of {CTLA}-4 blockade. Tumors in antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice did not respond to {CTLA} blockade. This defect was overcome by gavage with B. fragilis, by immunization with B. fragilis polysaccharides, or by adoptive transfer of B. fragilis–specific T cells. Fecal microbial transplantation from humans to mice confirmed that treatment of melanoma patients with antibodies against {CTLA}-4 favored the outgrowth of B. fragilis with anticancer properties. This study reveals a key role for Bacteroidales in the immunostimulatory effects of {CTLA}-4 blockade.

Endophytes are microbes, such as fungi and bacteria, that inhabit healthy plant tissue without causing disease (1). As symbionts, they constitute part of a diverse and ecologically important plant microbiome. Endophyte communities differ in composition among biomes and host species (2). They exhibit a wide range of host specificity and often enhance plant health (2, 3). The total number of estimated fungal species is in the millions, yet fewer than 100,000 have been characterized (4).

These protocols discourage race talk and allow society to enter into a conspiracy of silence regarding the detrimental impact oppression plays on persons of color. Facilitating difficult dialogues on race requires educators to recognize what makes such discussions difficult. For people of color, engaging in race talk exposes them to microaggressions that invalidate and assail their racial/ethnic identities.

In individuals with {COPD}, acquisition of novel bacterial strains is associated with onset of acute exacerbation of {COPD}, which leads to further lung dysfunction and enormous health-care costs. Recent study of the human microbiome, the total composite of the bacteria on the human body, posited the microbiome as the last human organ studied, as the microbiome performs a multitude of metabolic functions absent in the human genome. The largest project to study the human microbiome was the National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) human microbiome project ({HMP}) started in 2007 to understand the 'normal' microbiome. However due to the presumption that the healthy human lung was sterile, the respiratory tract was not included in that study. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed the investigation of the human respiratory microbiome, which revealed that the healthy lung does have a robust microbiome. Subsequent studies in individuals with {COPD} revealed that the microbiome composition fluctuates with severity of {COPD}, composition of the individual aero-digestive tract microbiomes, age, during an acute exacerbation of {COPD} and with the use of steroids and/or antibiotics. Understanding the impact of the microbiome on {COPD} progression and risk of exacerbation will lead to directed therapies for prevention of {COPD} progression and exacerbation.},

	abstract = {Gut microbes affect immunotherapy
The unleashing of antitumor T cell responses has ushered in a new era of cancer treatment. Although these therapies can cause dramatic tumor regressions in some patients, many patients inexplicably see no benefit. Mice have been used in two studies to investigate what might be happening. Specific members of the gut microbiota influence the efficacy of this type of immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Snyder et al.). Vétizou et al. found that optimal responses to anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen blockade required specific Bacteroides spp. Similarly, Sivan et al. discovered that Bifidobacterium spp. enhanced the efficacy of antiprogrammed cell death ligand 1 therapy.
Science, this issue, p. 1079 and p. 1084; see also p. 1031
T cell infiltration of solid tumors is associated with favorable patient outcomes, yet the mechanisms underlying variable immune responses between individuals are not well understood. One possible modulator could be the intestinal microbiota. We compared melanoma growth in mice harboring distinct commensal microbiota and observed differences in spontaneous antitumor immunity, which were eliminated upon cohousing or after fecal transfer. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal {RNA} identified Bifidobacterium as associated with the antitumor effects. Oral administration of Bifidobacterium alone improved tumor control to the same degree as programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 ({PD}-L1)–specific antibody therapy (checkpoint blockade), and combination treatment nearly abolished tumor outgrowth. Augmented dendritic cell function leading to enhanced {CD}8+ T cell priming and accumulation in the tumor microenvironment mediated the effect. Our data suggest that manipulating the microbiota may modulate cancer immunotherapy.

We also highlight the molecular pathways that mediate host–symbiont interactions that regulate proper immune function. Finally, we present recent evidence to support an emerging concept whereby disturbances in the bacterial microbiota result in immunological dysregulation that may underlie disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.

The gut microbiota has been implicated in the development of some cancers, such as colorectal cancer, but—given the important role our intestinal habitants play in metabolism—they may also modulate the efficacy of certain cancer therapeutics. Iida et al. (p. 967) evaluated the impact of the microbiota on the efficacy of an immunotherapy [{CpG} (the cytosine, guanosine, phosphodiester link) oligonucleotides] and oxaliplatin, a platinum compound used as a chemotherapeutic. Both therapies were reduced in efficacy in tumor-bearing mice that lacked microbiota, with the microbiota important for activating the innate immune response against the tumors. Viaud et al. (p. 971) found a similar effect of the microbiota on tumor-bearing mice treated with cyclophosphamide, but in this case it appeared that the microbiota promoted an adaptive immune response against the tumors.
The gut microbiota influences both local and systemic inflammation. Inflammation contributes to development, progression, and treatment of cancer, but it remains unclear whether commensal bacteria affect inflammation in the sterile tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that disruption of the microbiota impairs the response of subcutaneous tumors to {CpG}-oligonucleotide immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy. In antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to therapy, resulting in lower cytokine production and tumor necrosis after {CpG}-oligonucleotide treatment and deficient production of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity after chemotherapy. Thus, optimal responses to cancer therapy require an intact commensal microbiota that mediates its effects by modulating myeloid-derived cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. These findings underscore the importance of the microbiota in the outcome of disease treatment.

Cyclophosphamide is one of several clinically important cancer drugs whose therapeutic efficacy is due in part to their ability to stimulate antitumor immune responses. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that cyclophosphamide alters the composition of microbiota in the small intestine and induces the translocation of selected species of Gram-positive bacteria into secondary lymphoid organs. There, these bacteria stimulate the generation of a specific subset of “pathogenic” T helper 17 ({pTH}17) cells and memory {TH}1 immune responses. Tumor-bearing mice that were germ-free or that had been treated with antibiotics to kill Gram-positive bacteria showed a reduction in {pTH}17 responses, and their tumors were resistant to cyclophosphamide. Adoptive transfer of {pTH}17 cells partially restored the antitumor efficacy of cyclophosphamide. These results suggest that the gut microbiota help shape the anticancer immune response.

Their role as a possible cause of pulmonary disease is a frequent consideration, particularly in patients receiving immunosuppressive or longstanding antimicrobial therapy. At Memorial Hospital and New York Hospital, 30 patients with histologic evidence of Candida pulmonary infection were identified over a two year period. These infections reached the lungs by hematogenous spread in 10 patients and by aspiration in 16 patients. Most of the patients had malignant neoplastic disease. The Candida pulmonary disease appeared to be a significant clinical factor in only three cases. Experience from our institutions and from the literature indicates that Candida species rarely cause significant pulmonary disease. When such involvement is extensive, the patient is usually terminally ill from multiple other factors.},

In total, 687 controls, 457 Campylobacter cases and 193 Salmonella cases participated. None of the {SNPs} were associated with Campylobacter or Salmonella infections. None of the participants developed Guillain–Barré, Miller–Fisher or Reiter's syndrome. Reactive arthritis occurred in 5\% and 2\% of cases and controls, respectively. Campylobacter cases more frequently experienced gastroenteritis episodes than controls. Campylobacter or Salmonella infection in women, use of proton pump inhibitors and an {SNP} in the {IFNG} gene were independent risk factors for reactive arthritis. Another {SNP} in the {IFNG} gene and use of proton pump inhibitors were risk factors for recurrent episodes of gastroenteritis. In conclusion, reactive arthritis and recurrent gastroenteritis episodes are common after infection and host genetic factors play a role in susceptibility to these long-term health effects.},

We also highlight the molecular pathways that mediate host–symbiont interactions that regulate proper immune function. Finally, we present recent evidence to support an emerging concept whereby disturbances in the bacterial microbiota result in immunological dysregulation that may underlie disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Perhaps the mammalian immune system which appears designed to control microbes is, in fact, controlled by the microbes themselves.},

	abstract = {Vascular Streak Dieback ({VSD}) disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao) in Southeast Asia and Melanesia is caused by a basidiomycete (Ceratobasidiales) fungus Oncobasidium theobromae (syn. =Thanatephorus theobromae). The most characteristic symptoms of the disease are green-spotted leaf chlorosis or, commonly since about 2004, necrotic blotches, followed by senescence of leaves beginning on the second or third flush behind the shoot apex, and blackening of infected xylem in the vascular traces at the leaf scars resulting from the abscission of infected leaves. Eventually the shoot apex is killed and infected branches die. In susceptible cacao the fungus may grow through the xylem down into the main stem and kill a mature cacao tree. Infections in the stem of young plants prior to the formation of the first 3-4 lateral branches usually kill the plant. Basidiospores released from corticioid basidiomata developed on leaf scars or along cracks in the main vein of infected leaves infect young leaves. The pathogen commonly infects cacao but there are rare reports from avocado. As both crops are introduced to the region, the pathogen is suspected to occur asymptomatically in native vegetation. The pathogen is readily isolated but cultures cannot be maintained. In this study, {DNA} was extracted from pure cultures of O. theobromae obtained from infected cacao plants sampled from Indonesia. The internal transcribed spacer region ({ITS}), consisting of {ITS}1, 5.8S ribosomal {RNA} and {ITS}2, and a portion of nuclear large subunit ({LSU}) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of {ITS} sequences placed O. theobromae sister to Ceratobasidium anastomosis groups {AG}-A, {AG}-Bo, and {AG}-K with high posterior probability. Therefore the new combination Ceratobasidium theobromae is proposed. A {PCR}-based protocol was developed to detect and identify C. theobromae in plant tissue of cacao enabling early detection of the pathogen in plants. A second species of Ceratobasidium, Ceratobasidium ramicola, identified through {ITS} sequence analysis, was isolated from {VSD}-affected cacao plants in Java, and is widespread in diseased cacao collected from Indonesia.},

Data sets were analyzed individually and combined using Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference methods. All analyses supported the monophyly of the family Ceratobasidiaceae, which comprises the genera Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus. Multi-locus analysis revealed 10 well supported monophyletic groups that were consistent with previous separation into anastomosis groups based on hyphal fusion criteria. This analysis coupled with analyses of a larger sample of 165 rpb2 sequences of fungi in the Cantharellales supported a sister relationship between the Botryobasidiaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae and a sister relationship of the Tulasnellaceae with the rest of the Cantharellales. The inclusion of additional sequence data did not clarify incongruences observed in previous studies of Rhizoctonia fungi in the Cantharellales based on analyses of a single or multiple genes. The diversity of ecological and morphological characters associated with these fungi requires further investigation on character evolution for re-evaluating homologous and homoplasious characters.},

Recent technological advancements and expanded efforts have led to a tremendous growth in the collective knowledge of the human microbiome. This review will highlight some of the important recent findings in this area of research.

Recent findings
Studies have described the structure and functional capacity of the bacterial microbiome in the healthy state and in a variety of disease states. Downstream analyses of the functional interactions between the host and its microbiome are starting to provide mechanistic insights into these interactions. These data are anticipated to lead to new opportunities for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a variety of human diseases.

Summary
There is a fast growing collection of data describing the structure and functional capacity of the microbiome in a variety of conditions available to the research community for consideration and further exploration. Ongoing efforts to further characterize the functions of the microbiome and the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions will provide a better understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease.},

This group includes anamorphs of Tulasnella, Ceratobasidium, and Thanatephorus. Rhizoctonia can be classified according to the number of nuclei in young cells (multi-, bi-, and uninucleate). From nine Puerto Rican orchids we isolated 108 Rhizoctonia-like fungi. Our isolates were either bi- or uninucleate, the first report of uninucleate Rhizoctonia-like fungi as orchid endophytes. We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region of nuclear ribosomal {DNA} from 26 isolates and identified four fungal lineages, all related to Ceratobasidium spp. from temperate regions. Most orchid species hosted more than one lineage, demonstrating considerable variation in mycorrhizal associations even among related orchid species. The uninucleate condition was not a good phylogenetic character in mycorrhizal fungi from Puerto Rico. All four lineages were represented by fungi from Tolumnia variegata, but only one lineage included fungi from Ionopsis utricularioides. Tropical epiphytic orchids appear to vary in degree of specificity in their mycorrhizal interactions more than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Orchidaceae establish symbiotic relationships with fungi in the Rhizoctonia group, resulting in interactions beneficial to both organisms or in cell destruction in one of them (pathogenicity). Previous studies have focused mostly on terrestrial species with a few, preliminary studies, on epiphytes. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these symbioses, we evaluated the interaction between Oncidium sphacelatum Lindl. and the mycorrhizal fungus Thanatephorus sp. strain {RG}26 (isolated from a different orchid species) in vitro using morphometric and proteomic analyses. Evidence from the morphometric and microscopic analysis showed that the fungus promoted linear growth and differentiation of orchid protocorms during 98 days interaction. On day 63, protocorm development was evident, so we analyzed the physiological response of both organisms at that moment. Proteome results suggest that orchid development stimulated by the fungus apparently involves cell cycle proteins, purine recycling, ribosome biogenesis, energy metabolism, and secretion that were up-regulated in the orchid; whereas in the fungus, a high expression of proteins implicated in stress response, protein-protein interaction, and saccharides and protein biosynthesis were found in the symbiotic interaction. This is the first work reporting proteins differentially expressed in the epiphytic orchid-fungus interaction and will contribute to the search for molecular markers that will facilitate the study of this symbiosis in both wild orchids and those in danger of extinction.},

Combined analyses of {ITS} and {LSU} {rDNA} sequences from 41 isolates representing 28 {AG} of Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus supported at least 12 monophyletic groupings within Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus. There was strong support for separation of Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus, however, six sequences representing different {AG} of Ceratobasidium grouped with certain sequences within the Thanatephorus clade. Phylogenetic analysis of {ITS} sequence data from 122 isolates revealed 31 genetically distinct groups from Thanatephorus (21 groups) and Ceratobasidium (10 groups) that corresponded well with previously recognized {AG} or {AG} subgroups. Although phylogenetic analysis of {ITS} sequences provided evidence that several {AG} of Ceratobasidium may be more closely related with some {AG} from Thanatephorus, these relationships were not as strongly supported by bootstrap analysis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Biomedical researchers are very interested in measuring physical activity because sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity are well-established risk factors for chronic disease and adverse health outcomes. Many consumer physical activity monitors have accuracies similar to research-grade monitors for measuring steps and offer a relatively new tool for measuring physical activity in an ecological setting.
{AIM} To analyze how consumer physical activity monitors are currently used in biomedical research.
{METHOD} Searches were conducted in Ovid Medline, {PubMed} Medline, clinicaltrials.gov, and {NIH} {RePorter} using search terms including Fitbit, Jawbone, Apple watch, Garmin, Polar, Microsoftband, Misfit, Nike, Withings, and Xiaomi. Results were quantitated by category: condition/topic, intervention, enrollment status, study type and design, participant age, funding mechanism, and primary outcome.
{RESULTS} Fitbit devices were the most common consumer physical activity monitors used in published work (89\%), clinical trials (83\%), and {NIH}-funded research (95\%). Validity studies represented the plurality (19/40) of published studies involving consumer physical activity monitors. The design of the majority of clinical trials (116/127) and unique {NIH}-funded grants (20/25) involving Fitbit are interventional. The most common primary outcome measure reported in clinical trials using Fitbit is physical activity (50/127), with biomarkers of health (e.g., blood pressure, {HbA}1c, fasting glucose) being the second most prominent. The most common clinical conditions studied in clinical trials are mental and brain related (74/127), second most being body weight related (62/127).
{CONCLUSION} The current state and potential growth of the consumer monitor technology is transforming biomedical research, and is enabling us to ask new and more granular questions about physical activity in health and disease.

Many of these methods have been made possible by the program's completely new, and highly interactive, graphical user interface. The program provides many visual clues to the current state of a sequencing project and allows users to interact in intuitive and graphical ways with their data. The program has tools to display and manipulate the various types of data that help to solve and check difficult assemblies, particularly those in repetitive genomes. We have introduced the following new displays: the Contig Selector, the Contig Comparator, the Template Display, the Restriction Enzyme Map and the Stop Codon Map. We have also made it possible to have any number of Contig Editors and Contig Joining Editors running simultaneously even on the same contig. The program also includes a new 'Directed Assembly' algorithm and routines for automatically detecting unfinished segments of sequence, to which it suggests experimental solutions.},
