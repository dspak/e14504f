The statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution is routine in the phylogenetic analysis of {DNA} sequence alignments. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, most researchers are moving from phylogenetics to phylogenomics, in which large sequence alignments typically include hundreds or thousands of loci.

	abstract = {Vascular Streak Dieback ({VSD}) disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao) in Southeast Asia and Melanesia is caused by a basidiomycete (Ceratobasidiales) fungus Oncobasidium theobromae (syn. =Thanatephorus theobromae). The most characteristic symptoms of the disease are green-spotted leaf chlorosis or, commonly since about 2004, necrotic blotches, followed by senescence of leaves beginning on the second or third flush behind the shoot apex, and blackening of infected xylem in the vascular traces at the leaf scars resulting from the abscission of infected leaves. Eventually the shoot apex is killed and infected branches die. In susceptible cacao the fungus may grow through the xylem down into the main stem and kill a mature cacao tree. Infections in the stem of young plants prior to the formation of the first 3-4 lateral branches usually kill the plant. Basidiospores released from corticioid basidiomata developed on leaf scars or along cracks in the main vein of infected leaves infect young leaves. The pathogen commonly infects cacao but there are rare reports from avocado. As both crops are introduced to the region, the pathogen is suspected to occur asymptomatically in native vegetation. The pathogen is readily isolated but cultures cannot be maintained. In this study, {DNA} was extracted from pure cultures of O. theobromae obtained from infected cacao plants sampled from Indonesia. The internal transcribed spacer region ({ITS}), consisting of {ITS}1, 5.8S ribosomal {RNA} and {ITS}2, and a portion of nuclear large subunit ({LSU}) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of {ITS} sequences placed O. theobromae sister to Ceratobasidium anastomosis groups {AG}-A, {AG}-Bo, and {AG}-K with high posterior probability. Therefore the new combination Ceratobasidium theobromae is proposed. A {PCR}-based protocol was developed to detect and identify C. theobromae in plant tissue of cacao enabling early detection of the pathogen in plants. A second species of Ceratobasidium, Ceratobasidium ramicola, identified through {ITS} sequence analysis, was isolated from {VSD}-affected cacao plants in Java, and is widespread in diseased cacao collected from Indonesia.},

Data sets were analyzed individually and combined using Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference methods. All analyses supported the monophyly of the family Ceratobasidiaceae, which comprises the genera Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus. Multi-locus analysis revealed 10 well supported monophyletic groups that were consistent with previous separation into anastomosis groups based on hyphal fusion criteria. This analysis coupled with analyses of a larger sample of 165 rpb2 sequences of fungi in the Cantharellales supported a sister relationship between the Botryobasidiaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae and a sister relationship of the Tulasnellaceae with the rest of the Cantharellales. The inclusion of additional sequence data did not clarify incongruences observed in previous studies of Rhizoctonia fungi in the Cantharellales based on analyses of a single or multiple genes. The diversity of ecological and morphological characters associated with these fungi requires further investigation on character evolution for re-evaluating homologous and homoplasious characters.},

This group includes anamorphs of Tulasnella, Ceratobasidium, and Thanatephorus. Rhizoctonia can be classified according to the number of nuclei in young cells (multi-, bi-, and uninucleate). From nine Puerto Rican orchids we isolated 108 Rhizoctonia-like fungi. Our isolates were either bi- or uninucleate, the first report of uninucleate Rhizoctonia-like fungi as orchid endophytes. We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region of nuclear ribosomal {DNA} from 26 isolates and identified four fungal lineages, all related to Ceratobasidium spp. from temperate regions. Most orchid species hosted more than one lineage, demonstrating considerable variation in mycorrhizal associations even among related orchid species. The uninucleate condition was not a good phylogenetic character in mycorrhizal fungi from Puerto Rico. All four lineages were represented by fungi from Tolumnia variegata, but only one lineage included fungi from Ionopsis utricularioides. Tropical epiphytic orchids appear to vary in degree of specificity in their mycorrhizal interactions more than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Orchidaceae establish symbiotic relationships with fungi in the Rhizoctonia group, resulting in interactions beneficial to both organisms or in cell destruction in one of them (pathogenicity). Previous studies have focused mostly on terrestrial species with a few, preliminary studies, on epiphytes. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these symbioses, we evaluated the interaction between Oncidium sphacelatum Lindl. and the mycorrhizal fungus Thanatephorus sp. strain {RG}26 (isolated from a different orchid species) in vitro using morphometric and proteomic analyses. Evidence from the morphometric and microscopic analysis showed that the fungus promoted linear growth and differentiation of orchid protocorms during 98 days interaction. On day 63, protocorm development was evident, so we analyzed the physiological response of both organisms at that moment. Proteome results suggest that orchid development stimulated by the fungus apparently involves cell cycle proteins, purine recycling, ribosome biogenesis, energy metabolism, and secretion that were up-regulated in the orchid; whereas in the fungus, a high expression of proteins implicated in stress response, protein-protein interaction, and saccharides and protein biosynthesis were found in the symbiotic interaction. This is the first work reporting proteins differentially expressed in the epiphytic orchid-fungus interaction and will contribute to the search for molecular markers that will facilitate the study of this symbiosis in both wild orchids and those in danger of extinction.},

Combined analyses of {ITS} and {LSU} {rDNA} sequences from 41 isolates representing 28 {AG} of Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus supported at least 12 monophyletic groupings within Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus. There was strong support for separation of Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus, however, six sequences representing different {AG} of Ceratobasidium grouped with certain sequences within the Thanatephorus clade. Phylogenetic analysis of {ITS} sequence data from 122 isolates revealed 31 genetically distinct groups from Thanatephorus (21 groups) and Ceratobasidium (10 groups) that corresponded well with previously recognized {AG} or {AG} subgroups. Although phylogenetic analysis of {ITS} sequences provided evidence that several {AG} of Ceratobasidium may be more closely related with some {AG} from Thanatephorus, these relationships were not as strongly supported by bootstrap analysis.},
